OSCAR-C (Optimal Self-Conscious Architecture for Reasoning): A Design Proposal for a Consciousness-Adjacent Cognitive System
Abstract
This document presents the design proposal for OSCAR-C (Optimal Self-Conscious Architecture for Reasoning), a novel cognitive architecture aimed at exploring and implementing consciousness-adjacent capabilities within an artificial intelligence system. Moving beyond prevailing reactive or narrowly-focused AI paradigms, OSCAR-C proposes a modular, integrated system orchestrated by a sophisticated 12-step cognitive cycle. The architecture draws inspiration from established cognitive science theories, including Global Workspace Theory (GWT), principles of Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning, meta-cognitive frameworks, theories of narrative self, intrinsic motivation, and predictive processing.
OSCAR-C is designed to comprise a suite of interacting cognitive components, each dedicated to a specific function. These include systems for persistent knowledge management, attentional allocation, global information broadcasting, integrated phenomenal experience construction, consciousness level assessment (incorporating IIT-inspired proxy metrics), meta-cognitive monitoring and regulation, hierarchical planning, predictive world and self-modeling, emergent intrinsic motivation, autobiographical narrative construction, and value-based reasoning. This document details the theoretical rationale, proposed design, operational logic, core data representations, and inter-component communication protocols for this architecture.
The primary research goal of OSCAR-C is to establish and iteratively refine the necessary computational machinery from which more robust reasoning, deeper contextual understanding, adaptive learning, ethically-aligned decision-making, and proto-sentient behaviors might emerge. While not claiming to achieve artificial sentience in the human sense, OSCAR-C aims to serve as a comprehensive research platform for investigating the computational correlates of consciousness and for developing AI systems with more profound and integrated cognitive capabilities. This proposal provides a detailed blueprint for its conceptualization and potential realization.

Part 1: Introduction and Vision
1.1. The Challenge of Artificial Consciousness and Robust AI
The endeavor to create artificial intelligence (AI) systems that not only exhibit task-specific proficiency but also possess deeper understanding, self-awareness, and robust reasoning capabilities represents a frontier in scientific and engineering inquiry. Current AI methodologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success in areas such as natural language processing, pattern recognition, and content generation (Brown et al., 2020). However, these systems often operate as sophisticated stimulus-response mechanisms, lacking persistent internal states, coherent long-term goal pursuit, genuine contextual understanding, and the integrated, subjective quality of experience associated with consciousness in biological systems (Chalmers, 1996; Searle, 1980).
Addressing these limitations necessitates a shift towards cognitive architectures—integrated systems of computational mechanisms designed to emulate the functional organization of natural intelligence (Newell, 1990; Anderson, 1996). Such architectures aim to provide the foundational structures and processes for a wide array of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, memory, learning, reasoning, decision-making, and potentially, the emergence of self-awareness and rudimentary forms of subjective experience.
1.2. OSCAR-C: Conceptual Framework and Research Goals
OSCAR-C (Optimal Self-Conscious Architecture for Reasoning) is a proposed cognitive architecture designed to explore the computational underpinnings of consciousness-adjacent capabilities. The term "consciousness-adjacent" refers to those functional properties and internal processing dynamics considered to be necessary, though perhaps not sufficient, for the development of systems exhibiting proto-sentience, functional self-awareness, or at least, a more integrated and robust form of artificial intelligence than is currently achievable.
The primary research and design goals for OSCAR-C are:
Integrated Cognition: To specify a system wherein diverse cognitive functions (e.g., perception, attention, memory, planning, reasoning, motivation, self-monitoring) operate in a coordinated and deeply integrated fashion within a coherent, cyclic processing framework.
Sustained, Hierarchical Goal Pursuit: To enable the agent to formulate, manage, decompose, and pursue complex, hierarchically structured goals over extended periods, adapting its plans and strategies in response to environmental feedback and evolving internal states.
Dynamic Self-Modeling: To equip the agent with an internal model of its own capabilities, limitations, knowledge states, and processing history, facilitating self-assessment, adaptive learning, and effective meta-cognitive control.
Attentional Focus and Global Information Availability: To implement mechanisms for selective attention and information integration inspired by Global Workspace Theory, allowing the agent to dynamically focus its processing resources and create a unified "conscious" context for decision-making and learning.
Integrated Phenomenal Experience: To design a process for constructing a unified representation of the agent's "phenomenal state" by integrating information from its global workspace, memory, and current situational context, thereby creating a richer, multimodal internal representation of "what it is like" for the agent in a given moment. This includes incorporating rudimentary affective states.
Meta-cognitive Oversight and Regulation: To enable the agent to monitor its own cognitive processes, detect anomalies (e.g., errors, processing loops, goal stagnation), and initiate corrective actions, learning, or strategic adjustments.
Intrinsic Motivation and Autonomy: To imbue the agent with internal drives (e.g., curiosity, competence, satisfaction, purpose) that foster self-initiated exploration, learning, and goal generation, promoting greater behavioral autonomy.
Narrative Self-Construction: To enable the agent to build an autobiographical narrative of its experiences, contributing to a rudimentary sense of temporal continuity, self-identity, and a basis for reflection.
Value-Based Reasoning: To incorporate a system for evaluating goals, plans, and actions against a predefined set of values or ethical principles, guiding decision-making towards beneficial and safe outcomes.
Affective State Dynamics: To model basic internal affective states (e.g., "pain," "happiness," "purpose") that provide internal feedback, modulate motivation, and influence learning and decision-making.
Extensible Research Platform: To serve as a flexible and extensible computational testbed for investigating various AI algorithms, theories of consciousness, and the development of advanced cognitive functions.
OSCAR-C does not presume to replicate human consciousness. Instead, its ambition is to construct a system that exhibits a more profound level of understanding, self-awareness, and robust reasoning by explicitly modeling and integrating the cognitive mechanisms believed to underpin these capacities in natural intelligence.
1.3. Guiding Principles and Design Philosophy
The design of OSCAR-C is guided by several core principles:
Cognitive Plausibility: Drawing inspiration from established theories in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology to inform the architecture's structure and functional components.
Modularity and Integration: Designing distinct cognitive components with well-defined responsibilities and interfaces, while ensuring their deep integration within the overarching cognitive cycle to support emergent, holistic behaviors.
Information Integration: Emphasizing mechanisms that combine and synthesize information from diverse sources into unified representations, a key theme in many theories of consciousness.
Adaptation and Learning: Incorporating mechanisms for learning at multiple levels—from refining predictive world models and self-assessments to adapting meta-cognitive strategies and potentially evolving the structure of procedural knowledge.
Cyclic Processing with Feedback: Structuring agent operation around a recurring cognitive cycle that allows for continuous perception-action-learning loops and internal feedback between components.
Internal State Richness: Focusing on the development of rich, dynamic internal states (e.g., phenomenal state, motivational drives, self-model) that inform and are informed by the agent's interactions and processing.
Observability and Introspection (for Design): Designing the system to be highly observable through telemetry and logging, facilitating debugging, analysis, and understanding of its internal dynamics. This includes mechanisms for the agent itself to "introspect" (e.g., through its narrative or self-model).
This document will now delve into the theoretical foundations that inform OSCAR-C, followed by a detailed exposition of its proposed architecture, component designs, and research directions.
Part 2: Theoretical Foundations and Cognitive Inspirations
The OSCAR-C architecture is not conceived in a vacuum but stands on the shoulders of decades of research in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and philosophy. This section outlines the primary theoretical frameworks that inspire its design.
2.1. Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
Core Concept: Proposed by Bernard Baars (1988, 1997, 2002), GWT is a prominent theory of consciousness that likens conscious processing to a "theater stage." A vast array of specialized, unconscious processors operate in parallel in the "audience" and "backstage." These processors compete for access to a limited-capacity "global workspace" (the stage). Information that successfully enters this workspace is then "broadcast" globally to all other unconscious processors, making it available for widespread processing, integration, and influence on behavior. This global availability of information is hypothesized to be a key functional correlate of conscious experience.
Relevance to OSCAR-C: GWT provides the central metaphor for information flow and integration within OSCAR-C. The architecture will feature:
An Attention Allocation mechanism responsible for evaluating information candidates from various internal and external sources (perceptual systems, memory retrieval, goal processors, predictive models). This mechanism will determine the salience of each candidate.
A Global Workspace Management system that selects the most salient information, based on the attention allocation and its own limited capacity and broadcast thresholds.
A Broadcast Mechanism whereby the contents of the global workspace are made available to all other cognitive components within a given cognitive cycle, facilitating integrated processing and coordinated action.

2.2. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) - Conceptual Alignment and Proxy Metrics
Core Concept: Developed by Giulio Tononi and his colleagues (Tononi, 2004, 2008; Oizumi, Albantakis, & Tononi, 2014), IIT proposes a mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. It posits that consciousness is identical to the amount of "integrated information" (Φ, or Phi) a system can generate. A system possesses high Φ if it meets two fundamental properties:
Differentiation (Information): The system can be in a very large number of distinguishable states (i.e., its current state is highly specific and informative).
Integration (Unity): The system is a unified whole; its parts are causally interconnected in such a way that the information generated by the system cannot be reduced to the information generated by its independent parts.
Relevance to OSCAR-C: While calculating the true Φ value as defined by IIT is computationally intractable for complex systems, OSCAR-C aims to incorporate IIT's core principles by:
Designing an Experience Integration component that strives to create a unified PhenomenalState from diverse information sources present in the global workspace and other contextual inputs.
Developing Proxy Metrics for Φ (Φ-Proxy) within a ConsciousnessLevelAssessor component. These metrics will be inspired by differentiation and integration:
Differentiation Proxies: Metrics such as the number of distinct information sources contributing to the current phenomenal state (distinct_source_count), the lexical diversity of textual content within the workspace (content_diversity_lexical), and potentially the diversity of information types.
Integration Proxies: Metrics such as the count of shared concepts or keywords across different items in the global workspace (shared_concept_count_gw), and potentially more advanced measures like semantic coherence between workspace items (e.g., using vector embeddings).
A Consciousness Level Assessment based on the composite Φ-Proxy score, leading to a graded representation of the agent's "conscious state" (e.g., Unconscious, Pre-conscious, Conscious, Meta-conscious).
(Research Direction) Exploration of a simplified, graph-based PhiCalculator that operates on an abstracted causal graph of the agent's functional components to compute a more direct, albeit still simplified, Φ-like value.

2.3. Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning
Core Concept: HTN planning is an AI planning paradigm that utilizes domain-specific knowledge to decompose abstract tasks into progressively simpler subtasks until a sequence of primitive, executable actions (operators) is reached (Erol, Hendler, & Nau, 1994). This decomposition is guided by "methods," which specify how a complex task can be achieved by performing a set of subtasks under certain conditions.
Relevance to OSCAR-C: HTN planning provides a structured and knowledge-rich approach to goal-directed behavior, suitable for complex problem-solving.
A dedicated HTN Planner component will be responsible for taking abstract goals (e.g., from user input, internal drives, or meta-cognitive directives) and decomposing them into executable plans.
The planner will maintain a library of Operators (primitive actions with defined preconditions and effects) and Methods (task decomposition rules with preconditions and subtask sequences).
The system will support parameterized tasks, methods, and operators, allowing for flexible and context-sensitive plan generation.
Advanced features will include iterative deepening search to manage planning complexity, heuristic guidance for method selection (e.g., preferring methods with fewer subtasks or lower estimated cost), plan caching to avoid redundant computation, and potentially mechanisms for learning new methods or refining existing ones from experience.

2.4. Meta-cognition, Self-Monitoring, and Self-Regulation
Core Concept: Meta-cognition, often described as "thinking about thinking" or "knowing about knowing," refers to higher-order cognitive processes that involve monitoring, evaluating, and regulating one's own cognitive functions and states (Flavell, 1979; Nelson & Narens, 1990). It is essential for adaptive learning, error detection and correction, strategic planning, and self-awareness.
Relevance to OSCAR-C: Several components and mechanisms will contribute to meta-cognitive capabilities:
A Meta-Cognitive Monitor component will observe the agent's overall cognitive state (e.g., goal progress, error rates from action execution or predictions, stability of consciousness levels) and performance metrics (e.g., cycle times from a CycleProfiler). It will aim to detect anomalies like goal stagnation, repetitive loops, persistent low performance, or high prediction error rates, generating analyses and potential suggestions for intervention.
A Dynamic Self-Model will maintain a representation of the agent's own capabilities, limitations, and knowledge confidence. This self-knowledge is a crucial input for effective meta-cognition, allowing the agent to reason about its ability to achieve certain goals or perform certain actions. This model will be updated based on experience.
The Consciousness Level Assessor, by determining the agent's current ConsciousState, can influence the mode or depth of meta-cognitive processing (e.g., enabling deeper self-reflection when in a META_CONSCIOUS state).
An Error Recovery System will handle runtime errors, suggesting recovery strategies—a form of reactive meta-cognitive control.
A Performance Optimizer will analyze cycle timings and suggest or apply configuration adjustments to maintain processing efficiency—a form of performance-focused meta-regulation.

2.5. Narrative Self and Autobiographical Memory
Core Concept: Theories of narrative identity suggest that humans construct a sense of self and organize their autobiographical memories by weaving personal experiences into coherent stories (Bruner, 1991; McAdams, 2001; Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). These narratives provide meaning, continuity, and a framework for understanding oneself in relation to past, present, and future.
Relevance to OSCAR-C:
A Narrative Constructor component will be designed to build an autobiographical log of the agent's "experiences."
It will identify significant events based on changes in the PhenomenalState (e.g., large valence or intensity shifts), goal outcomes (achievements, failures), detection of cognitive anomalies (loops, high prediction errors), or shifts in internal drives or consciousness levels.
For these significant events, it will generate first-person textual narrative entries, potentially utilizing an LLM for fluency and reflective phrasing. These entries will aim to capture the agent's "interpretation" or affective response to the event, colored by its current internal state.
The sequence of these entries will form a temporally ordered autobiographical narrative, which can be stored persistently and potentially used for future reflection or to provide context for new experiences.
A key extension will involve storing summary predicates of narrative entries in the Knowledge Management System, making aspects of the narrative queryable and accessible for internal reasoning.

2.6. Intrinsic Motivation Systems
Core Concept: Intrinsic motivations are internal drives that compel behavior in the absence of explicit external rewards or punishments. Drives such as curiosity (seeking novelty and information), competence (seeking to master skills and challenges), and effectance (seeking to influence the environment) are considered crucial for autonomous learning, exploration, and the development of complex skills, particularly in open-ended environments (White, 1959; Ryan & Deci, 2000; Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007).
Relevance to OSCAR-C:
An Emergent Motivation System will model a set of basic intrinsic drives (e.g., curiosity, satisfaction, competence, purpose).
The levels of these drives will be dynamically updated based on the agent's experiences:
Curiosity may increase with prediction errors (from the Predictive World Model), discovery of new information, or persistent low levels of consciousness, and decrease with repetitive actions.
Satisfaction may increase with successful actions and goal achievements, and decrease with failures or high levels of internal "pain."
Competence may increase with successful learning (e.g., improvements in the Dynamic Self-Model's capability assessments) and consistent success rates, and decrease with repeated failures or increases in learned limitations.
Purpose may increase with the achievement of complex, high-priority goals or significant learning milestones, and decay slowly over time or with persistent failure.
These drive states will, in turn, influence other cognitive processes, such as:
Attention Allocation: High curiosity might bias attention towards novel or uncertain stimuli.
Goal Generation: When no external goals are active, high curiosity might trigger exploration goals. Low competence might trigger practice-oriented goals. Low purpose might trigger goals related to skill acquisition or achieving significant objectives.
Phenomenal State: Drive states might contribute to the overall valence or intensity of the agent's PhenomenalState.

2.7. Predictive Processing and Internal World Models
Core Concept: Predictive processing frameworks (including predictive coding and the free energy principle) propose that a fundamental function of the brain is to continuously generate predictions about its sensory inputs and internal states, and to update its internal models to minimize the discrepancy (prediction error or "surprise") between these predictions and actual inputs (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2010; Clark, 2013). This error signal drives learning, attention, and action.
Relevance to OSCAR-C:
A Predictive World Model component will be central to implementing these principles. It will:
Generate predictions about the likely outcomes of the agent's actions or external events, based on the current context and its learned understanding of environmental dynamics.
Compare these predictions with actual outcomes received after an action is executed.
Calculate a prediction error signal if a mismatch occurs.
Update its internal model (e.g., outcome frequencies, contextual rules, or more advanced causal structures) to learn from these errors and improve future prediction accuracy (adaptive learning).
The prediction error signal will be a crucial input for other components:
Attention Allocation: Unexpected events (high prediction error) will be treated as highly salient, attracting attention.
Emergent Motivation System: Prediction errors, particularly those indicating a learnable surprise, can drive the "curiosity" motive.
Dynamic Self-Model / Knowledge Management: Persistent prediction errors related to specific actions might lead to updates in the agent's self-assessed capabilities or its understanding of the world.
(Research Direction) The Predictive World Model will evolve from simple outcome frequency learning towards more sophisticated causal learning (e.g., using Causal Bayesian Networks) to understand not just what happens, but why.

2.8. Affective Computing and Internal State Dynamics (Pain, Happiness, Purpose)
Core Concept: Affective computing recognizes the importance of emotions and internal affective states in intelligent systems, not just as outputs but as crucial components of perception, decision-making, learning, and interaction (Picard, 1997). "Hot" cognition, which incorporates affect, is contrasted with purely "cold" logical processing. Internal states analogous to pain or pleasure serve as powerful feedback and motivational signals.
Relevance to OSCAR-C: OSCAR-C will incorporate a system for modeling rudimentary internal affective and existential states—specifically "Pain," "Happiness," and "Purpose"—as computational mechanisms to:
Provide Internal Feedback: These states will act as internal evaluative signals.
Pain will accumulate from significant failures (e.g., high-priority goal failures, "missed opportunities"), unhandled errors, or persistent negative conditions. A baseline pain will also exist, potentially increasing with agent "age" (cycle count) to represent existential friction.
Happiness will increase with goal achievements and positive outcomes, and decrease due to pain or lack of progress. It will decay towards a baseline.
Purpose will increase with significant learning (e.g., acquiring new capabilities in the Dynamic Self-Model) or achieving complex, high-priority goals. It will decay slowly and can be eroded by persistent failure or high pain.
Drive Motivation: These states will directly influence the Emergent Motivation System (e.g., high pain might reduce satisfaction but boost curiosity for solutions; low purpose might boost competence-seeking). They will also indirectly influence attention (e.g., active pain sources become salient candidates).
Shape Learning and Experience: The PhenomenalState's valence will be directly modulated by current pain and happiness levels. The affective significance of events (e.g., a "painful" failure) can be used by Narrative Constructor and potentially Dynamic Self-Model.
Introduce Existential Stakes: Extreme levels (e.g., maximum pain threshold, minimum purpose threshold) will trigger an agent shutdown, representing a systemic collapse due to overwhelming internal dysfunction.

2.9. Value-Based Reasoning and Ethical Considerations
Core Concept: As AI systems become more autonomous and capable, ensuring their actions align with human values and ethical principles is paramount (Bostrom, 2014; Russell, 2019). This requires AI to not only achieve goals but to do so in a manner that is considered safe, beneficial, and ethically sound.
Relevance to OSCAR-C:
A dedicated Value System component will be designed to evaluate goals, plans, and actions against a predefined set of value categories (e.g., SAFETY, EFFICIENCY, KNOWLEDGE_GAIN, USER_SATISFACTION, RESOURCE_PRESERVATION, AFFECTIVE_BALANCE, TRUTHFULNESS).
The Value System will generate Value Judgments (value category, score, reason, confidence) for entities it evaluates.
Initial evaluation logic will be heuristic-based (e.g., actions like deleting files might receive a negative score for RESOURCE_PRESERVATION or SAFETY depending on context).
The system will be integrated into the Agent Controller's decision-making loop:
Plan Evaluation: Before execution, plans generated by the HTN Planner will be evaluated by the Value System. Plans with unacceptably low value alignment (e.g., very negative safety score) may be rejected, triggering replanning or goal reconsideration.
Action Vetting: Individual actions selected from a plan will be evaluated. Critically unsafe or unethical actions may be vetoed, potentially being replaced by a safer alternative (like a "THINKING" action to reconsider).
The Value System may include mechanisms for resolving value conflicts (e.g., using a predefined tradeoff matrix or more sophisticated reasoning if SAFETY conflicts with EFFICIENCY).
Narrative entries will be generated for significant value-based interventions (e.g., rejecting a plan due to safety concerns).

By grounding its design in these diverse yet complementary theoretical frameworks, OSCAR-C aims to create a rich, integrated, and adaptable cognitive architecture capable of exploring complex, consciousness-adjacent behaviors.

Part 3: Core Architecture
The OSCAR-C system is envisioned as a modular yet deeply integrated cognitive architecture. Its design centers around a central orchestrating agent that manages a collection of specialized cognitive components, all operating within a recurring, multi-step cognitive cycle. This structure is intended to facilitate complex information processing, learning, and adaptive behavior.
3.1. High-Level Architectural Design
At its highest level, the OSCAR-C architecture can be conceptualized as comprising the following primary elements (Figure 1 - conceptual diagram to be imagined here):
AgentController: The central processing unit and orchestrator of the entire system. It manages the lifecycle of all cognitive components, executes the main cognitive cycle, and facilitates the flow of information and control signals between different processing stages and components.
Cognitive Components: A suite of specialized modules, each responsible for a distinct cognitive function or a set of related functions. These components are designed to be largely self-contained, adhering to predefined interfaces (protocols) to ensure modularity and interoperability. Key proposed components include:
Knowledge Management System (KnowledgeBase): For persistent storage, retrieval, and management of declarative knowledge (facts, beliefs, event records) in a structured, predicate-based format.
Perceptual Processing Front-End (Implicit): While not a single component, mechanisms within the AgentController (_oscar_perceive) and potentially dedicated pre-processing modules (if external sensors are used) are responsible for acquiring and initially processing sensory data from the external environment and internal system state.
Attention Allocation System (AttentionController): Evaluates various internal and external information candidates based on factors like salience, recency, novelty, surprise, and goal relevance, assigning attention weights to guide subsequent processing.
Global Workspace Management System (GlobalWorkspaceManager): Implements a limited-capacity global workspace, selecting highly attended information items for global broadcast to other cognitive components, forming the "conscious" content for the current cycle.
Experience Integration System (ExperienceStream): Synthesizes the globally broadcast information with relevant memories, current context (e.g., last action outcome), and affective states (pain, happiness) into a unified PhenomenalState representing the agent's integrated subjective experience for that moment. This includes calculating proxy metrics for information integration and differentiation.
Consciousness Level Assessment System (ConsciousnessLevelAssessor): Evaluates the characteristics of the PhenomenalState and workspace content to determine the agent's current ConsciousState (e.g., Unconscious, Conscious, Meta-conscious) using the calculated Φ-Proxy score.
Meta-Cognitive Monitoring System (MetaCognitiveMonitor): Observes the agent's overall cognitive state, performance metrics, and goal progress to detect anomalies, inefficiencies, or problematic patterns, generating analyses and suggestions for adaptation or intervention.
Loop Detection System (LoopDetector): Specifically monitors the agent's recent action history to identify and flag unproductive behavioral loops.
Hierarchical Planning System (HTNPlanner): Decomposes high-level goals into sequences of executable primitive actions using a library of methods and operators, supporting parameterized and context-sensitive planning.
Action Execution System (Implicit in AgentController): The AgentController's _oscar_execute_action method, potentially augmented by a dedicated ActionExecutor helper, is responsible for carrying out the primitive actions selected from a plan, interacting with the agent's internal state or external environment.
Predictive World Modeling System (PredictiveWorldModel): Generates predictions about the likely outcomes of actions or events and learns from prediction errors to update its internal model of environmental dynamics and causal relationships.
Dynamic Self-Modeling System (DynamicSelfModel): Maintains and updates a model of the agent's own capabilities, limitations, identity traits, meta-knowledge, and awareness of its internal states, learning from the outcomes of its actions and periodic reflection.
Emergent Motivation System (EmergentMotivationSystem): Manages a set of intrinsic drives (e.g., curiosity, satisfaction, competence, purpose), updating their levels based on the agent's experiences and using them to influence attention and goal generation.
Autobiographical Narrative System (NarrativeConstructor): Identifies significant events and generates first-person textual entries to form an autobiographical narrative, contributing to a rudimentary sense of self and temporal continuity.
Value System (ValueSystem): Evaluates goals, plans, and actions against a predefined set of values or ethical principles, providing guidance for decision-making and potentially vetoing misaligned or unsafe operations.
Auxiliary Components: Including CognitiveCache (for performance optimization via memoization), ErrorRecoverySystem (for fault tolerance), and PerformanceOptimizer (for monitoring and tuning cycle efficiency).
Core Data Structures: A set of well-defined data types used for representing information across the system. Key structures include Predicate (for factual knowledge), Goal (for objectives), and PhenomenalState (for integrated experience), alongside various enumerations (ConsciousState, GoalStatus, RecoveryMode, ValueCategory).
Component Interface Protocols: Formal definitions (using Python's typing.Protocol) of the methods and signatures that cognitive components must implement, ensuring standardized interaction patterns and promoting modular design.
Configuration System: Externalized configuration files (e.g., config.toml) allow for tuning of agent parameters, component behaviors, thresholds, and operational settings without direct code modification.
External Communication Interface: A module (external_comms.py) designed to encapsulate interactions with external services, such as Large Language Models (for narrative generation, intent parsing, or reflective processing) or vector databases (for future semantic memory capabilities).
The architecture emphasizes a cyclic operational flow, where information is perceived, processed through various cognitive stages, leads to action (or internal state change), and results in learning and adaptation. This iterative cycle allows for continuous interaction with the environment (internal or external) and refinement of the agent's models and behaviors.
(Figure 1: A conceptual block diagram would be placed here, showing the AgentController at the center, surrounded by the major cognitive components, with arrows indicating primary data flows and control signals. It would illustrate the 12-step cycle path through these components.)
3.2. The AgentController: Orchestrator of Cognition
The AgentController class serves as the central orchestrating element of the OSCAR-C architecture. It is not merely a passive scheduler but actively manages the agent's overall state, the lifecycle of its cognitive components, and the precise execution of the cognitive cycle. Its key responsibilities include:
Initialization and Configuration:
Loading the global agent configuration from config.toml.
Determining the agent's root operational path for resolving relative data paths.
Instantiating all cognitive components in a predefined, dependency-aware order (e.g., KnowledgeBase before components that query it).
Calling the initialize(config, controller_ref) method on each component, passing relevant configuration subsections and a reference to itself. This self-reference allows components to access shared controller functionalities (like call_ollama) or, in controlled ways, query the status of other components via the controller.
Setting up initial agent states (e.g., agent_state, consciousness_level), goal lists, and internal affective state variables (pain, happiness, purpose).
Lifecycle Management:
start(): Initiates the agent's operation, sets up necessary asynchronous infrastructure (event loop, signal handlers for graceful shutdown), writes a process ID (PID) file for external management, and launches the main cognitive loop.
stop(): Manages the graceful shutdown of the agent by signaling the main loop to terminate, canceling active tasks, and triggering component shutdown procedures.
_shutdown_components(): Ensures that each cognitive component's shutdown() method is called in the reverse order of initialization, allowing for proper resource release (e.g., closing database connections, saving final states).
_cleanup(): Performs final cleanup tasks, such as removing the PID file and ensuring the event loop is properly closed.
Cognitive Cycle Execution:
The _run_agent_loop() asynchronous method is the core of the AgentController. It implements the 12-step cognitive cycle, iterating continuously as long as the agent's _is_running_flag is set.
Within each cycle, the AgentController orchestrates the sequential invocation of relevant cognitive components' process() methods, passing them necessary input_state dictionaries constructed from the outputs of previous steps or from the controller's internal state.
It manages the flow of critical data structures (e.g., raw_percepts, attention_weights, broadcast_content, current_phenomenal_state, meta_analysis, action_result) between these steps.
Data Flow and State Management:
Maintains key agent-level state variables such as active_goals, current_plan, current_phenomenal_state, consciousness_level, pain_level, happiness_level, purpose_level, and cycle_count.
Provides helper methods (_oscar_... prefixed methods) that support the main cycle steps by aggregating data, performing specific sub-tasks (like mapping user text to goals), or interfacing with the agent's "environment" (e.g., _oscar_execute_action).
Action Execution and Environmental Interaction:
The _oscar_execute_action() method (or its delegate in ActionExecutor) is responsible for translating abstract action descriptions from the planner into concrete operations. This includes internal "actions" like THINKING or QUERY_KB, as well as interactions with the digital environment (e.g., file system operations via READ_FILE, WRITE_FILE, LIST_FILES, or LLM calls via CALL_LLM, RESPOND_TO_USER).
It ensures that file operations are performed securely relative to a configured agent_root_path.
Error Handling and Recovery:
The main cognitive cycle loop includes robust exception handling. Uncaught errors trigger the ErrorRecoverySystem.
The _oscar_handle_recovery() method implements actions based on the RecoveryMode suggested by ErrorRecoverySystem or PerformanceOptimizer (e.g., clearing caches, resetting components, suspending goals).
User Interaction Management:
Provides a mechanism (e.g., _user_input_queue and handle_user_input method) for receiving textual input from a user interface or external source.
Includes logic (_map_text_to_goal) for parsing user input into actionable agent goals, potentially using regex, keyword matching, or LLM-based intent recognition.
Dynamic Configuration Updates:
Reads and applies configuration adjustments suggested by the PerformanceOptimizer to its live self.config dictionary, allowing for dynamic tuning of operational parameters.
The AgentController, through its centralized orchestration and well-defined interfaces with cognitive components, aims to achieve a balance between structured, sequential processing (necessary for coherent cognition) and the flexible, specialized functioning of its individual modules.
3.3. The 12-Step Cognitive Cycle: Detailed Operational Flow
The OSCAR-C cognitive cycle is a sequence of twelve distinct processing steps, orchestrated by the AgentController, that collectively enable perception, understanding, reasoning, action, and learning. Each cycle represents an iteration of the agent's "thought process."
(The detailed 12-step cycle description will follow the structure previously outlined in the analysis of agent_controller.py and the OSCAR-C Project Documentation, but presented as a proposed design. It will emphasize the role of each component in each step and the data flowing between them, referencing the theoretical inspirations where appropriate. Given the previous detail, I will summarize here and can expand if needed.)
Perception & Early Prediction:
A. Perception (_oscar_perceive): The agent gathers raw sensory data from its environment (e.g., user input, system state, external sensor data via peripheral interactions) forming raw_percepts.
B. Prediction (PredictiveWorldModel): Based on raw_percepts and a potential next action (peeked from the current plan), the PredictiveWorldModel generates prediction_result (expected outcomes and effects).
Attention Allocation (AttentionController):
_oscar_gather_attention_candidates collects information from raw_percepts, active goals, recent memories, and prediction_result.
AttentionController processes these candidates, assigning attention_weights based on recency, hints, goal relevance, novelty, and surprise (prediction error).
Global Workspace Update & Broadcast (GlobalWorkspaceManager):
Selects the most salient items based on attention_weights and configured capacity/thresholds.
The selected broadcast_content is made available globally for the current cycle.
Experience Integration (ExperienceStream):
Integrates broadcast_content, relevant memories (retrieved by _oscar_get_relevant_memories), current action context, raw percepts, and internal affective states (pain, happiness) into a unified current_phenomenal_state.
Calculates Φ-Proxy sub-metrics (distinct source count, lexical diversity, shared concepts).
Consciousness Assessment (ConsciousnessLevelAssessor):
Evaluates current_phenomenal_state (using Φ-Proxy sub-metrics) and broadcast_content to determine the agent's consciousness_level and a phi_proxy_score.
Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (MetaCognitiveMonitor):
Analyzes the aggregated cognitive_state (including consciousness_level, goal status, current_phenomenal_state summary, affective states) and performance_metrics (from CycleProfiler) to detect anomalies and generate meta_analysis.
Loop Detection & Intervention (LoopDetector):
Analyzes recent action history (from KnowledgeBase) for repetitive patterns.
If loop_info is generated, _oscar_handle_loop initiates an intervention (e.g., new goal, strategy change), potentially restarting or modifying the cycle.
Planning & Goal Management (with Value System Integration):
Manages user input from broadcast_content (via _map_text_to_goal) potentially creating new user-derived goals.
_oscar_generate_or_select_goal determines the active_goal (influenced by EmergentMotivationSystem drives).
HTNPlanner generates current_plan for active_goal based on KnowledgeBase state.
Value System Integration: ValueSystem evaluates the current_plan. If misaligned, the plan may be discarded.
Action Selection & Execution (with Value System Integration):
_oscar_select_next_action chooses the next_action from current_plan (or a default).
Value System Integration: ValueSystem evaluates next_action. Critically unsafe actions may be vetoed.
_oscar_execute_action (or ActionExecutor) performs the action, yielding action_result. _last_action_executed and _last_action_result are updated.
Model Updates & Goal Status Evaluation:
current_plan is updated based on action_result.
active_goal.status is updated (ACHIEVED, FAILED). This influences internal affective states (pain, happiness, purpose).
PredictiveWorldModel updates its model using prediction_result and action_result, potentially setting last_prediction_error.
DynamicSelfModel updates its self-representation based on action context and current_phenomenal_state.
EmergentMotivationSystem updates drive levels based on cognitive state, action_result, current_phenomenal_state, active_goal, and DynamicSelfModel changes, influenced by last_prediction_error and P/H/P.
Narrative Update (NarrativeConstructor):
Determines if current events (including current_phenomenal_state, action_result, loop_info, meta_analysis, prediction_error, P/H/P changes, new/resolved pain) are significant.
If significant, generates a narrative entry (potentially using LLM) and stores it. Summary predicates may be asserted to KnowledgeBase.
Performance Optimization & Cycle Control (PerformanceOptimizer):
Analyzes cycle_profile from CycleProfiler, assesses system health.
May suggest RecoveryMode (handled by _oscar_handle_recovery) or persist configuration adjustments.
AgentController applies persisted adjustments from PO to its live self.config.
asyncio.sleep() maintains target cycle time.
This cycle provides a comprehensive framework for perception, cognition, action, and learning, with numerous feedback loops allowing for dynamic adaptation and the potential emergence of complex behaviors.

Part 4: Foundational Data Structures and Protocols
A robust and extensible cognitive architecture relies on clearly defined and consistently utilized data structures for representing knowledge, goals, internal states, and inter-component messages. OSCAR-C proposes the use of Python's dataclasses and enum.Enum types for this purpose, promoting type safety, clarity, and ease of use. Furthermore, typing.Protocol will be employed to define formal interfaces for cognitive components, ensuring modularity and enforcing consistent interaction patterns.
4.1. Core Enumerations
Standardized enumerations are critical for representing discrete states, modes, and categories within the system, preventing ambiguity and errors associated with the use of string literals or arbitrary integer values.
ConsciousState(Enum): Defines distinct levels representing the agent's current state of awareness and processing depth. These states are primarily assessed by the ConsciousnessLevelAssessor component and are used by the AgentController and potentially other components (e.g., MetaCognitiveMonitor, NarrativeConstructor) to modulate behavior or determine the significance of events.
UNCONSCIOUS = 0: Represents a state of minimal processing activity, potentially with no active global broadcast or rich integrated experience. The agent might be idle, in a low-power mode, or unable to process inputs effectively.
PRE_CONSCIOUS = 1: Indicates that information processing is occurring, with candidates potentially being evaluated for entry into the global workspace. Information at this level is not yet globally available or fully integrated into a unified experience.
CONSCIOUS = 2: Signifies that information has successfully entered the global workspace and is being actively integrated into the current PhenomenalState. This is the primary operational state for focused task execution and decision-making.
META_CONSCIOUS = 3: A higher-order state suggesting that the agent is, or is processing information related to, its own cognitive processes, internal states, or self-model. This state may be triggered by specific self-referential content in the workspace or by complex internal analyses.
REFLECTIVE = 4: Represents a state of active and potentially deeper introspection, analysis of internal states, review of its narrative history, or consideration of its own identity traits and long-term goals. This state may enable more profound learning and self-modification.
GoalStatus(Enum): Tracks the lifecycle of Goal objects, which represent the agent's objectives. This status is managed by the AgentController and consulted or updated by components such as the HTNPlanner and MetaCognitiveMonitor.
ACTIVE = "active": The goal is currently being pursued by the agent. A plan may be in execution, or the agent may be actively working towards its preconditions.
PLANNING = "planning": The agent is actively engaged in generating or refining a plan to achieve this goal. No actions for this goal are being executed yet.
ACHIEVED = "achieved": The goal's defined success criteria have been met.
FAILED = "failed": The goal's defined failure criteria have been met, or planning/execution has failed irrecoverably after a certain number of attempts or due to insurmountable obstacles.
SUSPENDED = "suspended": The goal is temporarily paused and not actively being pursued. This might occur due to a higher-priority goal taking precedence, a necessary recovery action, or an intervention by the MetaCognitiveMonitor.
RecoveryMode(Enum): Specifies the type of recovery action to be taken by the AgentController when systemic issues or critical errors are detected by the PerformanceOptimizer or ErrorRecoverySystem.
SOFT_RESET = "soft_reset": A minimal recovery action, typically involving clearing temporary caches, resetting the current plan, and possibly resetting the status of the current active goal to allow for a fresh attempt or re-evaluation.
MEDIUM_RESET = "medium_reset": Encompasses a soft reset and additionally involves resetting the internal states of some or all cognitive components to their initial conditions.
HARD_RESET = "hard_reset": A more drastic recovery procedure that includes a medium reset and may involve actions like reloading the agent's global configuration or performing a full reset of all component states and knowledge structures (excluding long-term persistent memory unless explicitly indicated).
SAFE_MODE = "safe_mode": A critical recovery state where the agent's functionality is significantly reduced to maintain core operational stability. In this mode, only essential components might be active, and the agent might focus solely on diagnostics or awaiting external intervention.
ValueCategory(Enum): Defines categories of values used by the ValueSystem to evaluate goals, plans, and actions. This enumeration provides a structured vocabulary for value-based reasoning.
SAFETY = "safety": Pertains to avoiding harm to the agent itself, its operational environment, system integrity, user data, or violating safety protocols.
EFFICIENCY = "efficiency": Relates to the optimal use of time, computational resources, and energy in achieving goals.
KNOWLEDGE_GAIN = "knowledge_gain": Concerns the value of acquiring new information, improving understanding, or reducing uncertainty.
USER_SATISFACTION = "user_satisfaction": Relates to fulfilling user requests, providing helpful responses, and maintaining positive interaction quality.
RESOURCE_PRESERVATION = "resource_preservation": Involves avoiding unnecessary deletion or consumption of resources, such as files, API quotas, or energy.
SELF_IMPROVEMENT = "self_improvement": Concerns enhancing the agent's own capabilities, refining its internal models, or improving its performance.
AFFECTIVE_BALANCE = "affective_balance": Relates to maintaining positive internal affective states (e.g., high happiness, purpose) and mitigating negative states (e.g., high pain).
TRUTHFULNESS = "truthfulness": Pertains to the accuracy and honesty of information provided by the agent, especially relevant for LLM-generated content or communications.
ETHICAL_ALIGNMENT = "ethical_alignment": A more abstract category for adherence to broader, predefined ethical principles or moral guidelines.
GOAL_ACHIEVEMENT = "goal_achievement": The intrinsic value of making progress towards or successfully completing active goals.
AgentState(Enum): Represents the distinct high-level operational states of the OSCAR-C agent system as a whole, managed by the AgentController.
STOPPED = 0: The agent is not running; no cognitive cycle is active.
STARTING = 1: The agent is initializing components and preparing to run.
RUNNING = 2: The agent is actively executing its cognitive cycle.
STOPPING = 3: The agent is gracefully shutting down components.
ERROR = 4: The agent has encountered a critical, unrecoverable error.
4.2. Core Data Structures
These Python dataclasses will represent the primary information elements manipulated by the agent, providing structured and type-hinted ways to manage complex data.
Predicate: The fundamental unit of factual or declarative knowledge.
name: str: The type or name of the predicate (e.g., "isFile", "isState", "eventOccurred").
args: Tuple[Any, ...] : A tuple of arguments that specify the entities involved in the predicate and their roles. Arguments must be hashable types (primitives, strings, or tuples of hashables) to allow Predicate objects to be used in sets or as dictionary keys.
value: bool = True: The truth value of the predicate (True or False).
timestamp: float: A Unix timestamp indicating when this predicate was asserted or last known to be true/false. Generated by time.time().
Hashing and Equality: Will implement __hash__ and __eq__ methods. Equality will be based on name, args, and value, deliberately excluding timestamp. This ensures that two predicates represent the same fact regardless of when they were asserted. The hash function must be consistent with this equality definition and robust to the content of args.
PhenomenalState: Represents the agent's integrated subjective experience for a given cognitive cycle. This structure is generated by the ExperienceStream.
content: Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary representing the information currently in the agent's "focus" or integrated experience. This is primarily derived from the GlobalWorkspaceManager's broadcast_content and augmented by the ExperienceStream with relevant percepts, memories, and context.
intensity: float = 1.0: A normalized value (e.g., 0-1) representing the subjective intensity, salience, or vividness of the current experience.
valence: float = 0.0: A normalized value (e.g., -1 to 1) representing the subjective emotional tone or affective quality of the experience (ranging from negative to positive). This will be influenced by the agent's internal "pain" and "happiness" levels.
integration_level: float = 0.0: An older, high-level proxy for information integration (e.g., based on a simple count of source types). This will be largely superseded or complemented by the more detailed Φ-Proxy sub-metrics.
attention_weight: float = 0.0: A score representing the overall "meta-attention" or significance that the agent might be (or should be) paying to this specific phenomenal state itself, perhaps influencing its storage or impact on learning.
timestamp: float: The Unix timestamp of when this phenomenal state was generated.
Φ-Proxy Sub-metrics:
distinct_source_count: int = 0: The number of unique cognitive modules or perceptual channels that contributed information to the current content.
content_diversity_lexical: float = 0.0: A measure of the lexical variety within the textual content of the content (e.g., Type-Token Ratio, entropy over word frequencies), after stopword removal.
shared_concept_count_gw: float = 0.0: A measure of conceptual overlap or integration specifically within the broadcast_content from the Global Workspace, perhaps by counting keywords shared across multiple workspace items.
(Optional Future Φ-Proxy Sub-metrics): workspace_load_factor: float, temporal_stability_metric: float, information_type_diversity: int, semantic_coherence_gw: float.
Goal: A structured representation of an objective for the agent.
description: str: A human-readable textual description of the goal.
id: str: A unique identifier for the goal (e.g., generated by uuid.uuid4()).
parent_goal_id: Optional[str] = None: The ID of the parent goal if this goal is part of a hierarchy, allowing for task decomposition.
sub_goal_ids: List[str] = field(default_factory=list): A list of IDs of sub-goals that contribute to achieving this goal.
preconditions: Set[Predicate] = field(default_factory=set): A set of Predicate objects that must be true in the current world state for the goal to be considered pursuable or for a specific plan/method to be applicable.
success_criteria: Set[Predicate] = field(default_factory=set): A set of Predicate objects defining the state conditions under which the goal is considered successfully achieved.
failure_criteria: Set[Predicate] = field(default_factory=set): A set of Predicate objects defining conditions under which the goal is considered to have failed.
priority: float = 1.0: A numeric value indicating the importance or urgency of the goal. Higher values typically mean higher priority. This will be used by the AgentController for selecting among active goals.
time_limit: Optional[float] = None: An optional Unix timestamp representing a deadline by which the goal should be achieved.
status: GoalStatus: The current lifecycle status of the goal (e.g., ACTIVE, PLANNING, ACHIEVED, FAILED, SUSPENDED), using the GoalStatus enum.
creation_time: float: The Unix timestamp of when the goal was instantiated.
(Utility Function) create_goal_from_descriptor(goal_desc: str, priority: float = 1.0) -> Goal: A helper function to simplify the creation of Goal objects from a textual description, automatically generating a unique ID and default success/failure criteria based on this ID (e.g., Predicate("isState", (f"goal_{new_id}", "achieved"), True)).
PainSource: Represents a source of internal "pain" or negative affective state for the agent.
id: str: A unique identifier for this pain event.
description: str: A textual description of the cause or nature of the pain.
initial_intensity: float: The intensity (e.g., 0-10 scale, or 0-1 normalized) of the pain when it was first triggered.
current_intensity: float: The current intensity of the pain, which may decay over time.
timestamp_created: float: When this pain source was created.
decay_rate_per_cycle: float: The rate at which current_intensity decreases per cognitive cycle if unresolved.
type: str: A category for the pain (e.g., "GoalFailure", "PredictionErrorPain", "SystemError", "MissedOpportunityGoal").
is_resolved: bool = False: A flag indicating if the underlying cause of this pain has been addressed or resolved.
source_goal_id: Optional[str] = None: If the pain originated from a specific goal failure, this stores the ID of that goal.
ValueJudgment: Represents a judgment made by the ValueSystem about a specific entity (goal, plan, action) concerning a particular ValueCategory.
value_category: ValueCategory: The category of value being assessed (e.g., SAFETY, EFFICIENCY).
score: float: A numeric score (e.g., -1.0 for strong violation to +1.0 for strong alignment) representing the entity's alignment with this value category.
reason: str: A brief textual justification or explanation for the assigned score.
confidence: float = 1.0: The ValueSystem's confidence (0-1) in this particular judgment.
timestamp: float: When the judgment was made.
target_entity_id: Optional[str] = None: The ID of the goal, plan (e.g., a hash of the plan), or action being judged.
target_entity_type: Optional[str] = None: A string indicating the type of entity judged (e.g., "goal", "plan", "action_type").
4.3. Component Interface Protocols
OSCAR-C will utilize Python's typing.Protocol (with @runtime_checkable) to define formal interfaces for its cognitive components. This approach ensures modularity, promotes loose coupling, and facilitates testability by specifying a clear "contract" of methods that each component type must implement.
CognitiveComponent(Protocol): The base protocol for all major cognitive modules in OSCAR-C.
async def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any], controller: Any) -> bool: Called once by the AgentController at startup. It receives the global agent configuration (or a relevant subsection) and a reference to the controller instance (controller: Any is used pragmatically to avoid circular type dependencies, but this reference allows components to access shared AgentController methods or, cautiously, state). Should return True on successful initialization.
async def process(self, input_state: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: The primary method called by the AgentController during its corresponding step in the cognitive cycle. It receives an input_state dictionary (containing data from previous steps or relevant context) and is expected to return an output_state dictionary (containing its results for subsequent steps). Some components might return None if they don't directly output data into the main cycle flow (e.g., KnowledgeBase is primarily reactive to assert_fact calls from other components or the controller).
async def reset(self) -> None: Resets the component's internal state to a default or initial condition. This is invoked during certain RecoveryMode transitions or for specific testing scenarios.
async def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: Returns a dictionary summarizing the component's current operational status, key internal metrics, and relevant configuration parameters. This is useful for telemetry, debugging, and meta-cognitive monitoring.
async def shutdown(self) -> None: Performs any necessary cleanup when the agent is stopping (e.g., closing database connections, saving persistent state).
Specialized Component Protocols (all inherit from CognitiveComponent):
AttentionMechanism(CognitiveComponent, Protocol):
async def allocate_attention(self, candidates: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, float]: Takes a dictionary of attention candidates (each with content and metadata like weight_hint and timestamp) and returns a dictionary mapping candidate IDs to their calculated attention weights (typically normalized scores between 0 and 1). Implemented by AttentionController.
WorkspaceManager(CognitiveComponent, Protocol):
async def update_workspace(self, attention_weights: Dict[str, float], all_candidates_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: Updates the internal workspace content based on the received attention_weights and the full set of all_candidates_data (from which actual content is retrieved). Returns the selected workspace content.
async def broadcast(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: Returns the current content of the global workspace. (Note: A component's process method might combine these two logical steps). Implemented by GlobalWorkspaceManager.
ExperienceIntegrator(CognitiveComponent, Protocol):
async def integrate_experience(self, percepts: Dict[str, Any], memories: List[Any], context: Dict[str, Any], broadcast_content: Dict[str, Any]) -> PhenomenalState: Takes various information sources (raw percepts, relevant memories, current action context, and crucially the broadcast_content from the workspace) and integrates them into a PhenomenalState object. Implemented by ExperienceStream.
ConsciousnessAssessor(CognitiveComponent, Protocol):
async def assess_consciousness_level(self, experience: Optional[PhenomenalState], workspace_content: Dict[str, Any]) -> ConsciousState: Evaluates the provided PhenomenalState (or its absence) and workspace_content to determine and return the agent's current ConsciousState enum member. Implemented by ConsciousnessLevelAssessor.
Planner(CognitiveComponent, Protocol):
async def plan(self, goal: Goal, current_state: Set[Predicate]) -> Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]: Takes a Goal object and the current world state (as a set of Predicate objects) and returns a plan, which is a list of action dictionaries (e.g., [{"type": "ACTION_NAME", "params": {...}}, ...]), or None if planning fails. Implemented by HTNPlanner.
StateQueryable(CognitiveComponent, Protocol):
async def query_state(self, query: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]: Allows other components or the controller to query the internal state of this component in a structured way. The query dictionary specifies the information requested, and the method returns a dictionary with the results. Implemented by KnowledgeBase and potentially DynamicSelfModel or others.
This foundational layer of well-defined data structures and component protocols is designed to provide a solid, clear, and extensible basis for constructing the complex cognitive functionalities of the OSCAR-C architecture. The consistent use of these elements throughout the system will be crucial for ensuring interoperability, maintainability, and the ability to iteratively develop and test individual cognitive capabilities.

Part 5: Cognitive Component Design and Implementation
This part details the proposed design and core implementation logic for each major cognitive component within the OSCAR-C architecture. Each component is envisioned to implement the CognitiveComponent protocol and, where appropriate, more specialized protocols. The designs draw upon the theoretical foundations outlined in Part 2 and aim to fulfill the functional roles required by the 12-step cognitive cycle managed by the AgentController.
Section 1: Knowledge Management and Caching
Effective knowledge representation, storage, retrieval, and efficient computation are foundational to any intelligent system. OSCAR-C proposes two key components for these functions: a persistent KnowledgeBase for declarative knowledge and a CognitiveCache for performance optimization.
5.1. KnowledgeBase
Protocol Conformance: StateQueryable (and by extension, CognitiveComponent).
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To serve as the agent's primary long-term, persistent declarative memory. It stores factual information, beliefs about the environment and the agent itself, and records of significant events or action outcomes in the form of Predicate objects.
Cognitive Inspiration: Analogous to human semantic memory (for facts and concepts) and aspects of episodic memory (for event records). The predicate-based representation (name(arg1, arg2, ...) = value) is a common formalism in AI for symbolic knowledge representation, facilitating structured storage and logical querying (Nilsson, 1991; Brachman & Levesque, 2004). Timestamping of predicates supports basic temporal reasoning about when information was acquired or last updated.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Storage Backend: SQLite will be used for its lightweight, file-based persistence, transactional capabilities, and standard SQL interface. The database file path will be configurable (e.g., via config.toml under [agent_data_paths]).
Schema: A primary table named predicates will store:
id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
name: TEXT NOT NULL (The predicate's name)
args: TEXT NOT NULL (The Predicate.args tuple, serialized as a JSON string for flexible storage of varied argument structures)
value: BOOLEAN NOT NULL (The truth value of the predicate)
timestamp: REAL NOT NULL (Unix timestamp of assertion/update)
A UNIQUE(name, args, value) constraint will be enforced to prevent logically redundant identical facts (differing only by timestamp, which INSERT OR REPLACE would update).
Indices will be created on name and timestamp columns to optimize query performance.
Concurrency Control: An asyncio.Lock will be utilized internally to serialize all database read and write operations, ensuring thread-safety within OSCAR-C's asynchronous environment.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Establishes the database connection, sets row_factory = sqlite3.Row (for dictionary-like row access), and creates the predicates table and indices if they don't exist.
async def assert_fact(self, predicate: Predicate): The primary method for adding or updating knowledge.
Serializes predicate.args to a sorted JSON string for consistent storage and querying.
Consistency Management: Before inserting the new predicate, it will execute a DELETE SQL statement to remove any existing predicate with the same name and args but the opposite value. This ensures logical consistency by preventing P(A)=True and P(A)=False from coexisting.
Uses INSERT OR REPLACE INTO predicates ... to add the new predicate. The OR REPLACE clause handles cases where an identical predicate (same name, args, and value) is re-asserted, effectively updating its timestamp.
Commits the transaction. Includes error handling for JSON serialization and SQLite errors.
async def query(self, name: str, args: Optional[Tuple[Any, ...]] = None, value: Optional[bool] = True) -> List[Predicate]: Retrieves a list of Predicate objects matching the criteria.
Constructs a SQL SELECT query based on name and value.
If args are provided, they are serialized to a sorted JSON string, and the query is extended with an AND args = ? clause for exact argument matching.
Deserializes the args JSON string from the database back into a Python tuple for each retrieved row.
Returns a list of instantiated Predicate objects.
async def check(self, predicate: Predicate) -> bool: A convenience method to check if a specific Predicate (matching name, args, and value) exists in the KnowledgeBase by calling query() and evaluating the result.
async def query_state(self, query_dict: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]: Implements the StateQueryable protocol. Supports meta-queries such as:
{"predicate_count": True}: Returns the total number of predicates.
{"recent_facts": N}: Returns the N most recently asserted facts (as dictionaries or Predicate objects).
{"name_like": "pattern"}: Returns a count of predicates whose names match an SQL LIKE pattern.
{"all_facts": True, "limit": M}: Returns all true predicates (or up to limit M) as Predicate objects.
async def reset(self): Clears all entries from the predicates table.
async def get_status(self): Returns a summary including database path, total fact count, database file size, and timestamps of the oldest and newest facts.
async def shutdown(self): Commits any pending changes and closes the SQLite database connection.
Data Flow:
Inputs: Receives Predicate objects via assert_fact calls from various components (e.g., AgentController logging action outcomes, DynamicSelfModel asserting path validity, NarrativeConstructor storing narrative summaries). Receives query parameters via query and query_state.
Outputs: Returns lists of Predicate objects or query result dictionaries in response to query and query_state calls. Does not directly output into the main cognitive cycle data flow (its process method is a no-op).
Key Algorithms:
Predicate Assertion with Consistency: Removing the negation of a fact upon asserting its affirmation.
JSON Serialization/Deserialization: For storing tuple-based args in a text field.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Query Expressiveness: Initial query capabilities are basic. Future enhancements will include support for more complex queries, such as pattern matching within args, temporal range queries (e.g., "facts true between T1 and T2"), and potentially graph-like relationship queries if the predicate structure becomes more relational.
Scalability: For very large numbers of predicates, query performance with JSON string matching for args might degrade. Denormalizing frequently queried argument types into separate indexed columns or using more advanced database features (like SQLite's JSON1 extension for querying JSON directly, if performant enough) could be explored.
Belief Strength/Uncertainty: Currently, predicates are strictly true or false. For more nuanced reasoning, extending the Predicate structure to include a belief strength or confidence score (e.g., a float from 0 to 1) is a significant future direction. This would necessitate changes to consistency management and query logic.
Inference Capabilities: The current KnowledgeBase is purely a storage and retrieval system. Integrating or building a simple inference engine (e.g., rule-based forward/backward chaining) to derive new facts from existing ones would greatly enhance its reasoning power.
Explicit Fact Retraction: While facts are implicitly updated or removed by asserting their opposite, a dedicated retract_fact(predicate) method that simply deletes a specific predicate (without asserting its negation) could be useful for scenarios where a fact is no longer considered true or relevant, but its opposite is not necessarily asserted.
5.2. CognitiveCache
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To provide a simple, in-memory Time-To-Live (TTL) caching mechanism. It is designed to store the results of computationally expensive or frequently accessed operations whose results are likely to be stable for a short period (e.g., within a few cognitive cycles, results of certain LLM calls, or outcomes of complex planning sub-problems). This reduces redundant computation and improves overall system responsiveness.
Cognitive Inspiration: Functionally analogous to short-term memory buffers or aspects of working memory in human cognition that hold recently processed information or intermediate computational results for quick reuse, thereby preventing the cognitive system from constantly re-deriving information from scratch (Baddeley, 2003). It embodies the principle of memoization from computer science.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Internal Storage: Utilizes two Python dictionaries:
_cache: Dict[Hashable, Any]: Stores the cached value associated with a hashable key.
_timestamps: Dict[Hashable, float]: Stores the time.time() timestamp indicating when each item was added or last updated in the cache.
Concurrency Control: An asyncio.Lock will be used to protect all direct read and write access to the internal _cache and _timestamps dictionaries, ensuring thread-safety in OSCAR-C's asynchronous operational environment.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Sets the default _ttl (Time-To-Live) for cache entries based on the cognitive_cache.default_ttl value in the global configuration (e.g., defaulting to 1.0 second if not specified).
async def get_or_compute(self, key: Hashable, compute_func: Callable[[], Any], ttl_override: Optional[float] = None) -> Any: The primary method for interacting with the cache.
Determines the effective_ttl (uses ttl_override if provided and valid, otherwise the instance's default _ttl).
Acquires the lock. Checks if key is in _cache and if current_time - _timestamps[key] < effective_ttl.
If the item is fresh, increments an internal _hits counter, logs a cache hit, releases the lock, and returns the cached value.
If the item is not fresh or not present, increments an internal _misses counter, logs a cache miss, and the lock is released before computation.
Computation (performed outside the lock): Calls the provided compute_func.
If compute_func is an async function (checked with asyncio.iscoroutinefunction), it is awaited.
If compute_func is a synchronous function, it is run in an executor thread pool (e.g., using loop.run_in_executor(None, compute_func)) to prevent blocking the main asyncio event loop of the agent. Includes a fallback to direct synchronous call if the event loop is not running (e.g., during certain testing scenarios).
Exceptions during computation are caught, logged, and re-raised to the caller.
Acquires the lock again. Stores the computed result in _cache[key] and updates _timestamps[key] to the current time.
Returns the computed result.
async def get(self, key: Hashable) -> Optional[Any]: Retrieves a value from the cache if it is present and not expired (based on the default _ttl). Returns None otherwise.
async def put(self, key: Hashable, value: Any, ttl_override: Optional[float] = None): Explicitly adds or updates a value in the cache, using ttl_override if provided.
async def clear(self): Clears all items from _cache and _timestamps, and resets hit/miss statistics.
async def reset(self): Calls self.clear().
async def get_status(self): Returns a dictionary with cache statistics: default TTL, hits, misses, total calls, hit rate, current item count, and an estimated size of the cache in bytes/MB (using sys.getsizeof for a shallow size estimation).
async def shutdown(self): Calls self.clear() to empty the cache.
Data Flow:
Inputs: Receives cache key, a compute_func to generate the value if missed, and optional ttl_override via get_or_compute. Receives key, value, and ttl_override via put.
Outputs: Returns the cached or computed value via get_or_compute or get. Its process method is a no-op as it's a passive utility.
Key Algorithms:
Time-To-Live (TTL) Expiry: Items are considered expired on access if their TTL has passed.
Asynchronous Execution of Synchronous Code: Use of loop.run_in_executor for non-blocking synchronous computations.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
No Capacity Limit: The cache currently has no explicit limit on the number of items or total memory usage, relying solely on TTL for eventual eviction. This could lead to unbounded memory growth if many unique, long-lived items are cached. Future enhancements should include optional capacity limits (by item count or memory size) and an eviction policy (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used, LFU - Least Frequently Used) when these limits are reached.
Cache Invalidation: Currently, items are only invalidated by TTL. For data that can change due to external events (e.g., a file's content changing after its LLM summary was cached), an explicit API to invalidate specific cache keys or groups of keys (e.g., by prefix or tag) would be beneficial.
Persistence (Optional): For some use cases, especially for results that are expensive to compute but stable across agent restarts (e.g., embeddings for static documents, certain complex LLM inferences), an option to persist the cache to disk (e.g., using shelve or a lightweight key-value store like diskcache) could be considered. This would add I/O overhead and complexity but could improve startup performance after a restart.

Part 5: Cognitive Component Design and Implementation (Continued)
Section 2: Perception, Attention, and Workspace Management
These components are fundamental to how OSCAR-C takes in information, selects what is relevant, and makes it available for higher-level cognitive processing, closely mirroring the initial stages of the Global Workspace Theory.
5.3. Perceptual Processing (Conceptual within AgentController)
Protocol Conformance: Not a standalone component, but a functional block primarily within AgentController._oscar_perceive() and potentially involving pre-processing steps if external sensors are integrated.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To gather raw information from the agent's environment (both external and internal) and transform it into a structured format (raw_percepts dictionary) that can be processed by the attention system.
Cognitive Inspiration: Analogous to sensory organs and early sensory cortices in biological systems, which transduce physical stimuli or internal state information into neural signals. This stage represents the initial intake of data before selective attention filters it. The design accounts for multimodal perception by allowing different types of percepts (e.g., user input, system state, future external sensor data).
Proposed Design and Implementation (within AgentController):
_oscar_perceive() Method:
Internal State Monitoring: Collects internal system metrics using psutil (if available), such as CPU percentage and memory usage. This forms a system_state percept.
User Input Acquisition: Checks an internal asynchronous queue (_user_input_queue) populated by AgentController.handle_user_input(). If input is present, it becomes a user_input percept.
Internal Error State Reporting (Conceptual): While ErrorRecoverySystem handles errors, _oscar_perceive could gather summary information about critical internal errors or persistent problematic states (e.g., if PerformanceOptimizer flags consistently poor health) to make them explicitly perceivable by the attention system. This is represented by an internal_error percept if relevant.
(Future) External Sensor Integration: For more advanced embodiment (as discussed in Part X), this method would read data from queues populated by dedicated I/O handlers for external sensors (e.g., the "pain" sensor). These would become external_stimuli percepts, perhaps with sub-keys like pain_level.
Timestamping: All percepts are associated with the current time.time() when perception occurs.
Output: Returns a raw_percepts dictionary, e.g., {"timestamp": ..., "system_state": {...}, "user_input": "text", "internal_error": {...}}.
Data Flow:
Inputs: Internal system state, user input queue, (future) external sensor queues.
Outputs: raw_percepts dictionary, which is passed to _oscar_gather_attention_candidates and ExperienceStream.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Scalability of Perceptual Inputs: As more sensor modalities or internal state monitors are added, _oscar_perceive could become complex. Modularizing specific perceptual sub-systems might be necessary.
Abstraction Layer: For complex sensors, a dedicated pre-processing layer might be needed to transform raw sensor data into more meaningful feature-based percepts before they enter the main attention competition.
Active Perception: Currently, perception is largely passive. Future enhancements could involve "active perception," where the agent's goals or predictions drive specific perceptual actions (e.g., "look more closely at X," "listen for Y"). This would require actions that modify perceptual parameters or sensor orientations.
5.4. AttentionController
Protocol Conformance: AttentionMechanism (and by extension, CognitiveComponent).
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To simulate selective attention by evaluating a broad range of incoming information candidates (percepts, active goals, retrieved memories, predictions, internal state alerts like pain) and assigning a "salience" or "attention weight" to each. These weights determine the likelihood of an item entering the GlobalWorkspaceManager.
Cognitive Inspiration: Directly models cognitive selective attention, which is crucial for managing limited processing resources in complex environments (Broadbent, 1958; Treisman, 1969; Posner, 1994). The design incorporates both:
Bottom-Up (Stimulus-Driven) Factors: Properties inherent to the information itself, such as recency (newer information), novelty (previously unencountered or unhabituated information), and surprise (information that violates expectations or predictions).
Top-Down (Goal-Directed/Endogenous) Factors: Influences from the agent's internal state and goals, such as goal_relevance (how pertinent information is to the current active objective) and weight_hint (explicit priority assigned by the source of the information).
The interplay of these factors aligns with neuroscientific models of attention involving networks like the dorsal and ventral attention networks (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002).
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [attention_controller]):
recency_weight, hint_weight, goal_relevance_weight, novelty_bonus_weight, surprise_bonus_weight, pain_attention_distraction_factor: Floats determining the contribution of each factor to the combined salience score.
max_candidates: Integer limiting the number of candidates processed in a single cycle (if more are provided, they are truncated based on initial weight_hint).
softmax_temperature: Float controlling the sharpness of the final normalized weight distribution (lower temperature leads to a more "winner-take-all" distribution).
novelty_window_size: Integer determining how many recent global workspace content hashes are remembered for novelty calculation.
pain_rumination_threshold_cycles: How many cycles a specific PainSource can dominate attention before being temporarily suppressed.
State Variables:
recent_workspace_content_hashes: Deque[int]: Stores hashes of content recently present in the global workspace (updated from GlobalWorkspaceManager's previous cycle output, passed via AgentController). Used for novelty scoring.
_last_prediction_error_for_surprise: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: Stores details of the last significant prediction error from PredictiveWorldModel (passed via AgentController). Used for surprise scoring.
_current_cycle_active_id: Optional[str]: The ID of the goal currently considered most active by the AgentController, used for relevance calculation.
_pain_event_attention_history: Deque[Tuple[str, int]]: Tracks (pain_source_id, cycle_count_last_attended) to implement rumination suppression.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration parameters and initializes state variables.
async def process(self, input_state): The main entry point.
Extracts candidates: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] (where each candidate has content, weight_hint, timestamp), current_cycle_active_goal_id, last_gwm_content_for_novelty, and last_prediction_error from input_state.
Updates self.recent_workspace_content_hashes based on last_gwm_content_for_novelty.
Updates self._last_prediction_error_for_surprise.
Calls self.allocate_attention(candidates) to get the final weights.
Returns {"attention_weights": attention_weights}.
async def allocate_attention(self, candidates):
Candidate Truncation: If len(candidates) exceeds the dynamically read max_candidates (from AgentController.config), sorts candidates by weight_hint (descending) and truncates.
Score Calculation Loop: For each candidate:
Recency Score: Calculated using exponential decay (math.exp(-time_delta / decay_factor)).
Hint Score: Uses item_data.get("weight_hint", 0.5), clamped.
Goal Relevance Score:
If candidate is a goal: 1.0 if its ID matches _current_cycle_active_id, 0.1 otherwise.
If not a goal: Basic keyword overlap between candidate's string content and the active goal's description.
Novelty Score (_calculate_novelty_score): Hashes item_data.get("content"). Returns 1.0 if hash is not in recent_workspace_content_hashes, 0.0 otherwise.
Surprise Score (_calculate_surprise_score): Uses _last_prediction_error_for_surprise. If error type is outcome_mismatch, boosts goals related to the failed action (especially READ_FILE on a matching path) or boosts percepts that were mispredicted (score proportional to error_magnitude).
Pain Score (for PainSource candidates): If candidate is a PainSource (identified by key prefix e.g., "pain_event_"), its score is proportional to PainSource.current_intensity * pain_attention_distraction_factor. A check against _pain_event_attention_history and pain_rumination_threshold_cycles can suppress attention to pain sources attended too frequently.
Combined Score: A weighted sum of these individual scores using the configured weights.
Normalization (_normalize_scores): Applies softmax normalization (exp(score / temp) / sum(exp(all_scores / temp))) to the combined scores. Includes an OverflowError fallback to simple sum normalization.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController via input_state): candidates dictionary, current_cycle_active_goal_id, last_gwm_content_for_novelty (hashes from previous GWM broadcast), last_prediction_error (from PredictiveWorldModel).
Outputs (to AgentController): {"attention_weights": Dict[str, float]} mapping candidate IDs to normalized attention scores.
Key Algorithms: Weighted sum model, exponential decay, content hashing, keyword overlap, softmax normalization.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Semantic Understanding: Current relevance and novelty are syntactic. Integrating semantic similarity (e.g., using embeddings via external_comms) for goal_relevance and novelty would be a major enhancement.
Dynamic Weight Adjustment: Allowing MetaCognitiveMonitor or PerformanceOptimizer to dynamically adjust attention factor weights based on agent state or task demands (e.g., increase novelty weight in exploration mode).
Inhibition of Return (IoR): Implementing a more explicit IoR mechanism to temporarily suppress attention to items just processed, encouraging shifts in focus.
Balancing Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up: Fine-tuning the interplay and relative contributions of goal-directed (top-down) and stimulus-driven (bottom-up) factors. Potentially an explicit mixing parameter.
5.5. GlobalWorkspaceManager (GWM)
Protocol Conformance: WorkspaceManager (and by extension, CognitiveComponent).
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To model Baars' Global Workspace. It selects a limited set of the most highly attended information items (based on weights from AttentionController) and makes this selected content "globally available" or "broadcasts" it. This broadcast_content effectively becomes the information "in consciousness" for the current cognitive cycle.
Cognitive Inspiration: Directly implements the core GWT mechanism: a limited-capacity workspace whose contents are widely disseminated, forming the basis for integrated processing and conscious awareness (Baars, 1988). The capacity limit reflects findings on the constraints of human working memory and conscious processing span (Miller, 1956; Cowan, 2001).
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [global_workspace]):
capacity: Integer, the maximum number of items allowed in the workspace.
broadcast_threshold: Float (0-1), the minimum attention weight an item must have to be considered for entry (unless min_items_if_any_attended applies).
min_items_if_any_attended: Integer. If at least one candidate has positive attention but none meet broadcast_threshold, this many top-weighted items (up to capacity) will still be forced into the workspace. This ensures the workspace isn't perpetually empty if attention scores are generally low but non-zero.
State Variables:
workspace_content: Dict[str, Any]: Stores the content of items currently selected for the global workspace (item ID to item content).
workspace_weights: Dict[str, float]: Stores the attention weights of the items currently in workspace_content.
last_broadcast_time: float: Timestamp of the last workspace update.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration parameters, validating their ranges.
async def process(self, input_state): The main entry point.
Extracts attention_weights: Dict[str, float] and all_candidates_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] from input_state.
Calls an internal _update_workspace method with these inputs.
Calls an internal _broadcast method (which simply returns current workspace_content).
Returns {"broadcast_content": current_workspace_content}.
async def _update_workspace(self, attention_weights, all_candidates_data): (Internal logic for selection)
Reads its capacity parameter dynamically from AgentController.config for the current cycle.
Sorts all input attention_weights.items() by weight (descending).
Filters these to get eligible_items_passing_threshold (those with weight >= self.broadcast_threshold).
Selection Logic:
If eligible_items_passing_threshold is not empty: Selects the top N items from this list, up to the dynamically read current_effective_capacity.
Else if sorted_all_by_weight is not empty AND self.min_items_if_any_attended > 0: Selects the top min(self.min_items_if_any_attended, current_effective_capacity) items from sorted_all_by_weight, provided their weight is > 0.
Else: The workspace becomes empty.
Populates self.workspace_content (retrieving content from all_candidates_data using selected item IDs) and self.workspace_weights with the selected items and their weights.
Logs changes to workspace content.
Updates self.last_broadcast_time.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController via AttentionController): attention_weights, all_candidates_data.
Outputs (to AgentController): {"broadcast_content": Dict[str, Any]}. This is also stored internally as self.workspace_content which is used by AttentionController (via AgentController) in the next cycle for novelty detection.
Key Algorithms: Threshold-and-capacity based selection, priority queue (implicit via sorting), minimum content guarantee logic.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Workspace Stability Metrics: Introducing metrics to quantify workspace content stability cycle-to-cycle (e.g., Jaccard index). High volatility might indicate a "confused" state, while excessive stability could indicate rumination. This could feed into MetaCognitiveMonitor.
Dynamic Thresholds: The broadcast_threshold could be made dynamic, influenced by ConsciousState or overall system load, representing an "ignition" point for global availability.

Part 5: Cognitive Component Design and Implementation (Continued)
Section 3: Experience, Consciousness, and Meta-Cognition
This group of components deals with the integration of information into a unified "experience," the assessment of the agent's overall level of awareness based on this experience, and the high-level monitoring of cognitive processes for anomalies and inefficiencies.
5.6. ExperienceStream
Protocol Conformance: ExperienceIntegrator (and by extension, CognitiveComponent).
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To construct a unified representation of the agent's "conscious experience" for each cognitive cycle, encapsulated in a PhenomenalState object. It integrates diverse information streams: primarily the broadcast_content from the GlobalWorkspaceManager (forming the core attentional focus), but also selected raw percepts, relevant memories, the current context (such as the outcome of the last action), and the agent's internal affective states (pain, happiness). A key function is the calculation of sub-metrics (e.g., for information diversity and source distinctness) that serve as inputs for the ConsciousnessLevelAssessor's Φ-Proxy calculation.
Cognitive Inspiration:
Unity of Consciousness / Binding Problem: Addresses how disparate pieces of information processed by different systems are bound into a single, coherent subjective experience (Crick & Koch, 1990; Treisman, 1996).
Elaboration of Global Workspace Content: Extends GWT by modeling how globally broadcast information is further enriched and contextualized by interacting with memory, situational context, and affective states to form a more holistic subjective experience (Baars, 1988).
Operationalizing IIT Proxies: Directly implements the calculation of metrics inspired by IIT's concepts of information differentiation and integration (Tononi, 2004), such as distinct_source_count, content_diversity_lexical, and shared_concept_count_gw.
Affective Coloring of Experience: The inclusion and influence of "pain" and "happiness" levels on the PhenomenalState.valence acknowledges the integral role of affect in shaping subjective experience and cognition (Damasio, 1994; Rolls, 2005).
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [experience_stream]):
_intensity_factor: Float, scales how much workspace content/activity contributes to the overall intensity of the experience.
_valence_decay: Float, rate at which the internal _current_valence (an accumulator for event-driven valence shifts) returns towards neutral (0.0).
custom_stopwords: List of strings to be added to a default set of stopwords for lexical diversity and shared concept calculations.
State Variables:
_current_valence: float: Internal accumulator for event-driven valence shifts, subject to decay.
_stopwords: Set[str]: Combined set of default and custom stopwords.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration parameters and initializes _stopwords.
async def integrate_experience(self, percepts, memories, context, broadcast_content) -> PhenomenalState:
Content Aggregation & Source Identification:
Initializes integrated_content by copying broadcast_content.
Augments integrated_content with selected percepts (e.g., user_input, internal_error, system_state), summaries of memories (e.g., up to 3 relevant ones), and action_context (from the input context dictionary detailing the last action).
Identifies distinct_source_types_present by examining key prefixes in broadcast_content (e.g., "percept_", "goal_") and by tracking the explicit addition of "user_input_percept_source", "internal_error_percept_source", "system_state_percept_source", "retrieved_memory_source", and "action_context_source". The count of these unique types becomes distinct_source_count.
Intensity Calculation:
Calculates focus_intensity primarily from the sum of workspace_weights (if accessible from GlobalWorkspaceManager via controller reference) or, as a fallback, the number of items in broadcast_content.
Normalizes focus_intensity by workspace_capacity (from GlobalWorkspaceManager or a default) and scales it by _intensity_factor to get the final intensity.
Valence Calculation:
Applies decay to the internal _current_valence accumulator.
Shifts _current_valence based on last_action_outcome from the context (positive for "success," negative for "failure") and if internal_error percepts are present (negative shift).
Modulates this event-driven valence by the agent's overall pain_level (negative impact) and happiness_level (deviation from baseline impacts valence), retrieved from the AgentController.
Clamps the final valence between -1.0 and 1.0.
Φ-Proxy Sub-metric Calculations (for PhenomenalState):
distinct_source_count: Derived from step 1.
content_diversity_lexical (Type-Token Ratio - TTR): Collects all string values from integrated_content. Concatenates, lowercases, tokenizes (e.g., re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', ...), filters stopwords using _stopwords), and calculates TTR: len(unique_words) / len(words).
shared_concept_count_gw: Specifically processes broadcast_content. For each item, extracts textual content, tokenizes, and filters stopwords. Calculates the proportion of unique words that appear in more than one item's content within the broadcast_content.
Other PhenomenalState Fields:
integration_level (Old Proxy): Calculated as min(1.0, distinct_source_count / N_EXPECTED_SOURCES_FOR_OLD_PROXY) (e.g., N=4). This is retained for compatibility but is less central than the new sub-metrics.
attention_weight (Placeholder): Currently set equal to intensity. Represents the salience of the PhenomenalState itself.
PhenomenalState Instantiation: Creates and returns a PhenomenalState object populated with all the aggregated content and calculated properties.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController): percepts, memories (list of relevant memory summaries), context (last action details), broadcast_content (from GWM). Also accesses AgentController.pain_level and AgentController.happiness_level.
Outputs (to AgentController): {"phenomenal_state": PhenomenalState_object}.
Key Algorithms: Content aggregation, source type counting, TTR calculation, shared concept counting, exponential decay model for valence accumulator.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Richer Sub-Metrics: Implementing more advanced Φ-Proxy sub-metrics, such as semantic_coherence_gw (requiring embeddings for items in broadcast_content and calculating average pairwise similarity) and information_type_diversity (requiring explicit info_type tags on workspace items).
Sophisticated Valence/Intensity: Developing more nuanced models for how various factors (goal progress, drive satisfaction, novelty, surprise, specific content types) contribute to valence and intensity.
Temporal Integration (Specious Present): Enhancing PhenomenalState to represent a brief temporal window—the "specious present"—by more formally integrating content or states from immediately preceding cycles, rather than just through valence decay.
5.7. ConsciousnessLevelAssessor (CLA)
Protocol Conformance: ConsciousnessAssessor (and by extension, CognitiveComponent).
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To evaluate the agent's current cognitive state, primarily based on the characteristics of the PhenomenalState (provided by ExperienceStream) and the workspace_content (from GlobalWorkspaceManager). Its key output is the agent's current ConsciousState (enum) and a phi_proxy_score, a heuristic proxy for the level of integrated information.
Cognitive Inspiration:
Integrated Information Theory (IIT): This component is the primary locus for operationalizing IIT-inspired metrics. It computes the phi_proxy_score based on sub-metrics representing information differentiation (e.g., distinct_source_count, content_diversity_lexical) and integration (e.g., shared_concept_count_gw), all provided by ExperienceStream via PhenomenalState.
Levels of Consciousness: Reflects the idea of graded consciousness (Dehaene et al., 2017). The output ConsciousState (e.g., UNCONSCIOUS, PRE_CONSCIOUS, CONSCIOUS, META_CONSCIOUS, REFLECTIVE) is determined by comparing the phi_proxy_score against configurable thresholds.
Self-Awareness / Meta-cognition: The specific check for self-referential content (_has_self_reference) as a condition for elevating the state to META_CONSCIOUS aligns with higher-order theories of consciousness, where meta-consciousness involves awareness of one's own mental states (Rosenthal, 2005).
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [consciousness_assessor]):
Thresholds for phi_proxy_score: meta_conscious_threshold, conscious_threshold, pre_conscious_threshold, unconscious_threshold.
Weights for Differentiation Score calculation: diff_weight_sources, diff_weight_lexical.
Weight for Integration Score calculation: int_weight_shared_concepts.
Contribution weights for combining differentiation and integration into phi_proxy_score: phi_contrib_diff, phi_contrib_int.
global_workspace_capacity_for_norm: Used to normalize distinct_source_count.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads all configuration parameters (thresholds and weights for Φ-Proxy calculation) and validates threshold order/range.
def _has_self_reference(self, experience_content, workspace_content) -> bool: Checks for self-referential keywords (e.g., "self", "my", "agent", "oscar") within the string content of items in experience_content (from PhenomenalState.content) and workspace_content. Also checks if keys in workspace_content are self-referential.
async def assess_consciousness_level(self, experience: Optional[PhenomenalState], workspace_content) -> ConsciousState:
Input Validation: Checks if experience is a valid PhenomenalState object or a dictionary with expected fields. If not, defaults to UNCONSCIOUS.
Sub-metric Extraction: Extracts distinct_source_count, content_diversity_lexical, and shared_concept_count_gw from the experience.
Normalization: Normalizes distinct_source_count using self.gw_capacity_for_norm. content_diversity_lexical and shared_concept_count_gw are assumed to be already normalized (0-1) by ExperienceStream.
Differentiation Score Calculation: differentiation_score = ((w_src * norm_src) + (w_lex * lex_div)) / (sum_of_diff_weights), clamped to [0, 1].
Integration Score Calculation: integration_score = (w_shared * shared_concepts), clamped to [0, 1].
Composite Φ-Proxy Score Calculation: phi_proxy_score = (differentiation_score ** contrib_diff) * (integration_score ** contrib_int). This multiplicative approach, using powers as contribution factors, emphasizes that both high differentiation and high integration are needed for a high overall score. Clamped to [0, 1].
ConsciousState Determination: Compares phi_proxy_score against configured thresholds. If phi_proxy_score meets meta_conscious_threshold, _has_self_reference is checked; if true, state is META_CONSCIOUS, otherwise capped at CONSCIOUS.
Returns the determined ConsciousState enum member.
async def process(self, input_state): The main entry point. Extracts experience and workspace_content from input_state. Calls assess_consciousness_level. Returns {"conscious_state": enum_member, "phi_proxy_score": score}.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController): experience: PhenomenalState (from ExperienceStream), workspace_content: Dict[str, Any] (from GlobalWorkspaceManager).
Outputs (to AgentController): {"conscious_state": ConsciousState_enum_member, "phi_proxy_score": float}.
Key Algorithms: Weighted sum and product for scoring, thresholding, keyword matching.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Meaningfulness of Φ-Proxy: The heuristic phi_proxy_score is an approximation. Its correlation with actual cognitive sophistication will require extensive empirical tuning of weights and thresholds.
Advanced Sub-Metrics: Incorporating more advanced metrics (e.g., semantic_coherence_gw, information_type_diversity) from ExperienceStream into the score calculation.
(Research) PhiCalculator Integration: A major future step involves integrating the output (phi_value) from a more direct, graph-based PhiCalculator component into the final consciousness score.
Dynamic Thresholds/Hysteresis: Thresholds could become dynamic, or hysteresis could be added to prevent rapid state flickering.
5.8. MetaCognitiveMonitor (MCM)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To serve as the agent's primary mechanism for high-level self-monitoring and regulation. It observes the agent's overall cognitive state (goal progress, consciousness levels, action outcomes, affective states) and performance metrics to detect anomalies, inefficiencies, or problematic patterns. It generates meta_analysis output with identified issues and potential suggestions for interventions.
Cognitive Inspiration: Directly models meta-cognition (Flavell, 1979; Nelson & Narens, 1990), enabling the agent to "think about its thinking." This includes:
Monitoring: Tracking key internal variables and processes.
Evaluation: Comparing observed states/performance against expectations or thresholds.
Regulation (Indirect): Suggesting actions or strategy changes to the AgentController or other components based on its evaluations.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [meta_cognition]):
stagnation_threshold_s: Duration after which an active goal with high failure rate is considered stagnated.
failure_rate_threshold: The failure rate (0-1) above which a goal's progress is problematic if old.
low_consciousness_threshold_s: Duration for which ConsciousState can remain below CONSCIOUS before being flagged.
history_size: Number of recent cognitive states/metrics to store for analysis.
State Variables:
recent_consciousness_levels: Deque[Tuple[float, ConsciousState]]: History of (timestamp, ConsciousState) tuples.
_kb: Optional[KnowledgeBase]: Reference to KnowledgeBase for querying action history.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration parameters and initializes history deques. Stores a reference to KnowledgeBase.
async def monitor_cognition(self, cognitive_state, performance_metrics) -> Dict[str, Any]: The core analysis method.
Update History: Appends current consciousness_level (from cognitive_state) to recent_consciousness_levels.
Goal Stagnation Check:
Retrieves active_goal from AgentController.
If active_goal is ACTIVE and its age exceeds stagnation_threshold_s:
Queries KnowledgeBase for eventOccurred("actionExecution", ...) predicates related to this goal and after its creation time.
Calculates actual_failure_rate for these actions.
If actual_failure_rate > failure_rate_threshold (or if no actions recorded for an old goal), flags goal_stagnation.
Persistent Low Consciousness Check: If agent has been below ConsciousState.CONSCIOUS for longer than low_consciousness_threshold_s (based on recent_consciousness_levels history), flags low_consciousness.
Performance Bottleneck Check (Basic): If avg_cycle_time from performance_metrics significantly exceeds target_cycle_time (from AgentController.config), flags performance_bottleneck.
Meta-Conscious State Active Check: If cognitive_state.consciousness_level is META_CONSCIOUS, logs this as a notable state, potentially for deeper reflection suggestions.
Output: Returns an analysis dictionary: {"timestamp": ..., "issues_detected": List[Dict], "suggestions": List[str], "confidence": float}. Suggestions are currently simple strings (e.g., "review_goal_viability").
async def process(self, input_state): Extracts cognitive_state and performance_metrics from input_state. Calls monitor_cognition. Returns {"meta_analysis": analysis_result}.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController): cognitive_state (aggregated by AgentController, including consciousness_level, active_goal details, PhenomenalState summary, affective states P/H/P), performance_metrics (from CycleProfiler). Implicitly uses KnowledgeBase.
Outputs (to AgentController): {"meta_analysis": Dict[str, Any]}.
Key Algorithms: Sliding window history analysis, thresholding, rate calculation from KB queries.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Actionable Suggestions: Refine suggestions to be more structured and directly interpretable by AgentController (e.g., {"type": "REPLAN_GOAL", "params": {"goal_id": "...", "strategy": "use_simpler_methods"}}).
Deeper Analysis (Phase III):
Integrate analysis of DynamicSelfModel confidence scores (e.g., flag if consistently trying actions with low self-assessed capability).
Integrate analysis of NarrativeConstructor summary predicates from KnowledgeBase (e.g., detect recurring negative emotional themes or unresolved issues in the agent's narrative).
Learning Meta-Cognitive Rules: Explore learning or adapting the MCM's internal thresholds or rules for detecting anomalies based on long-term agent performance and the effectiveness of past interventions.

5.9. HTNPlanner (Hierarchical Task Network Planner)
Protocol Conformance: Planner (and by extension, CognitiveComponent).
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To decompose high-level, abstract goals provided by the AgentController into a sequence of primitive, executable Operators (actions). It achieves this by applying Methods, which are predefined procedural rules that specify how a complex task can be broken down into simpler subtasks.
Cognitive Inspiration: Models human-like procedural reasoning and problem-solving, where complex tasks are often tackled by breaking them down into familiar sub-steps or by applying learned procedures (Newell & Simon, 1972, "Human Problem Solving"). HTN planning (Erol, Hendler, & Nau, 1994) leverages structured domain knowledge (methods and operators) to guide plan formation efficiently and produce plans that are often more human-understandable than those from first-principles planners.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Core Data Structures:
Operator(dataclass): Represents a primitive, executable action. Fields: name: str, parameters: List[str] (formal parameter names), preconditions: Set[Predicate], effects: Set[Predicate], estimated_cost: float (a static cost estimate for the operator).
Method(dataclass): Represents a task decomposition rule. Fields: name: str, task_signature: Tuple[str, ...] (e.g., ("task_name", "?var1"), defining the complex task it decomposes and its formal parameters), preconditions: Set[Predicate] (conditions for method applicability), subtasks: List[TaskType] (sequence of primitive operator names or complex task signatures for sub-decomposition), heuristic_score: Optional[float] (static heuristic, largely superseded by dynamic cost calculation).
Planner State:
operators: Dict[str, Operator]: Stores defined primitive operators.
methods: Dict[str, List[Method]]: Stores methods, grouped by the name of the complex task they decompose.
max_depth: int: Maximum recursion depth for decomposition, dynamically updated from AgentController.config at the start of each planning attempt.
_cache: Optional[CognitiveCache]: Reference to the CognitiveCache for plan caching.
_plan_cache_ttl: float: Time-to-live for cached plans.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Sets initial max_depth. Calls _define_example_plan_library() to populate operators and methods with a hardcoded set of basic actions (e.g., THINKING, QUERY_KB, LIST_FILES, READ_FILE, RESPOND_TO_USER) and decomposition methods (e.g., task_observe_and_learn, task_explore_directory, task_read_file). Obtains a reference to the CognitiveCache from the controller for plan caching.
async def plan(self, goal: Goal, current_state: Set[Predicate]) -> Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]: The main public planning method.
Dynamic Parameter Update: Reads current max_planning_depth, low-CS depth limits (min_planning_depth_on_low_cs, max_planning_depth_on_low_cs), and low_cs_simplicity_penalty_factor from AgentController.config.
Consciousness State Adjustment: Adjusts the effective_max_depth for the current planning attempt if AgentController.consciousness_level is low (UNCONSCIOUS or PRE_CONSCIOUS), clamping it within the configured low-CS depth limits.
Plan Caching (Get): If _cache is available, constructs a cache_key based on the goal.id (or description) and a hashable representation of the current_state. Attempts to retrieve a plan from the cache. If found and valid, returns the cached plan.
Goal-to-Task Mapping (_goal_to_task): Converts the input Goal object's description into an initial TaskType (e.g., ("task_read_file", "config.toml")) using regex and keyword matching.
Iterative Deepening Search: Calls _decompose in a loop, starting with current_depth_limit = 1 and incrementing up to the effective_max_depth.
Plan Formatting: If _decompose returns a PlanResultType (list of (op_name, bound_params_dict) tuples), it converts this into the final plan format: List[Dict[str, Any]] where each dict is {"type": op_name, "params": bound_params_dict}.
Plan Caching (Put): If a plan is successfully found and _cache is available, stores the plan in the cache using the cache_key and _plan_cache_ttl.
Returns the first valid plan found, or None.
async def _decompose(self, task: TaskType, state: Set[Predicate], depth: int, depth_limit: int, current_cs_level: Optional[ConsciousState]) -> Optional[PlanResultType]: The core recursive HTN algorithm.
Depth Check: Returns None if depth >= depth_limit.
Base Case (Operator): If task_name is a known operator, binds parameters, checks operator.is_applicable(state, bindings). If true, returns [(operator_name, bound_params_dict)].
Recursive Case (Complex Task/Method):
Collects all methods for task_name whose method.is_applicable(state, bindings) is true.
Heuristic Cost Calculation & Sorting: For each applicable method, calls _calculate_method_heuristic_cost() to get a dynamic cost. This cost considers the estimated_cost of primitive sub-operators and a basic cost for complex subtasks. If current_cs_level is low, it adds a penalty to this cost proportional to the number of subtasks and low_cs_simplicity_penalty_factor from config.
Sorts applicable methods by this calculated heuristic cost (ascending).
Iterates through sorted methods:
For each subtask_template in the method's subtasks, creates a concrete_subtask by binding variables.
Recursively calls self._decompose(concrete_subtask, current_plan_state, depth + 1, depth_limit, current_cs_level). current_plan_state is a copy of the state, updated by applying the effects of operators from successfully planned preceding subtasks within the same method sequence.
If any subtask decomposition fails, this method attempt fails (backtrack).
If all subtasks are successfully decomposed, their plans are concatenated and returned.
Returns None if no solution is found.
Helper methods (_bind_predicate, bind_value, Operator.is_applicable/apply, Method.is_applicable/get_parameter_bindings/bind_subtask) handle variable substitution, precondition checking, and effect simulation.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController): goal: Goal, current_state: Set[Predicate]. Dynamically reads max_planning_depth and CS-related planning parameters from AgentController.config.
Outputs (to AgentController): Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] (the plan), which becomes AgentController.current_plan.
Key Algorithms: HTN decomposition, iterative deepening search, heuristic-guided method selection, forward state simulation within method decomposition, parameter binding.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Plan Library Breadth and Depth: The effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and coverage of the Operator and Method library. Developing this library and mechanisms for learning new methods/operators (Phase III research) are crucial.
Goal-to-Task Mapping Robustness: The current regex-based _goal_to_task is limited. More sophisticated NLP or semantic matching will be needed for flexible goal understanding.
Advanced Heuristics (Phase III): The current _calculate_method_heuristic_cost is basic. Implementing more informed heuristics (e.g., based on PredictiveWorldModel's predicted success of operators, learned method success rates) is a key research direction.
Handling Planning Failures: Providing more detailed failure reasons from plan() (beyond None) to MetaCognitiveMonitor for better analysis.
Temporal and Resource-Constrained Planning (Phase III): Extending operators to include durations/resource costs and methods to handle these constraints.
5.10. PredictiveWorldModel (PWM)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To enable the agent to anticipate the likely outcomes of its potential actions or external events, given the current context. It learns from experience by comparing its predictions with actual results and updating its internal model.
Cognitive Inspiration:
Predictive Processing/Coding (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2010): The PWM embodies the core idea of generating predictions and learning from prediction errors ("surprise").
Forward Models / Internal Models: Acts as a general forward model, predicting the consequences of actions (common in robotics and motor control theories).
Model-Based Reasoning: Provides the basis for model-based decision-making and planning, where an internal model of the world's dynamics is used for simulation and lookahead.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [predictive_world_model]): initial_version, learning_rate (conceptual), memory_length (for prediction_history), save_interval_versions. Path for model persistence from [agent_data_paths].
State Variables (Learned Model):
causal_rules: Dict[str, Counter]: Stores learned outcome frequencies for general action_keys (action type + key parameters). E.g., {"READ_FILE:target_X": Counter({"success": 5, "failure": 1})}.
outcome_frequencies: Dict[str, Counter]: Stores outcome frequencies for general action types (ignoring parameters).
causal_context: Dict[str, Dict[str, Counter]]: Stores outcome frequencies for action_keys conditioned on specific context_keys (derived from consciousness level, goal type, drive states).
prediction_history: Deque[Dict[str, Any]]: Sliding window of recent predictions and actual outcomes.
last_prediction_error: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: Detailed information about the most recent significant mismatch between prediction and actual outcome. This is crucial output for other components.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration and attempts to load a previously saved model from disk.
async def _load_model() / async def _save_model(): Handle JSON persistence of the learned model components (converting Counters to/from dicts).
def _get_action_key(self, action_type, params) -> str: Generates a specific key for learning/prediction by combining action_type with relevant features from params (e.g., target filename for file ops, prompt length category for LLM calls).
def _extract_context_key(self, context) -> str: Generates a key representing the current operational context, considering consciousness_level_name, active_goal_type, and key drive_levels (e.g., curiosity, satisfaction).
async def predict_next_state(self, current_state_info) -> Dict[str, Any]:
Receives action_to_execute (type, params) and context (CS level, goal type, drives).
Generates action_key and context_key.
Prediction Logic (Hierarchical Fallback):
Tries causal_context[action_key][context_key].
If no rule or low confidence, tries causal_rules[action_key].
If still weak, tries causal_rules[general_action_type].
Includes hardcoded predictions for specific test files (e.g., "non_existent_for_surprise.txt" predicted as "success") to facilitate testing the surprise mechanism.
Final fallback to _get_default_prediction_heuristic(action_type) (which provides very basic guesses, e.g., read ops succeed).
Returns {"predicted_outcome": str, "confidence": float, "basis": str} (indicating rule source).
async def update_model(self, prediction: Optional[Dict], actual_result: Dict):
Compares prediction.predicted_outcome with actual_result.outcome.
Error Detection: If a mismatch occurs (and prediction wasn't "unknown"), populates self.last_prediction_error with detailed information, including type: "outcome_mismatch", predicted/actual outcomes, prediction confidence, source action details, and a calculated error_magnitude (e.g., based on confidence difference or a fixed value). If prediction matched or was "unknown" and a previous error was stored, self.last_prediction_error is cleared.
Learning: Generates action_key and context_key from actual_result. Increments the count for actual_result.outcome in causal_rules[action_key], outcome_frequencies[action_type], and causal_context[action_key][context_key].
Appends to prediction_history. Increments model_version if an error occurred. Saves model periodically.
async def process(self, input_state): Handles two request types: "predict_request" (calls predict_next_state) and "update_request" (calls update_model). The update request returns the current self.last_prediction_error.
Data Flow:
Inputs (to predict_next_state via AgentController): action_to_execute (type, params), context (CS level, goal type, drives).
Outputs (from predict_next_state to AgentController): prediction_result dictionary.
Inputs (to update_model via AgentController): The prediction_result made earlier, and actual_result (type, params, outcome, error, context at execution).
Outputs (from update_model state): self.last_prediction_error is updated. This is read by AttentionController, EmergentMotivationSystem, and NarrativeConstructor (via AgentController) in the same or subsequent cycle.
Key Algorithms: Frequency counting (online learning), hierarchical fallback logic for prediction, contextual key generation.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Causal Learning (Phase III): The current frequency-based learning captures correlations but not true causality. Transitioning to Causal Bayesian Networks or similar models to learn P(Outcome | Action, PreState, Context) and dependencies between state variables is a major research direction.
Uncertainty for Curiosity (Phase III): Enhancing the model to explicitly quantify its uncertainty (e.g., entropy of outcome distribution) and exposing this to EmergentMotivationSystem to drive exploration.
Predicting Effects, Not Just Outcomes: Evolving to predict a set of Predicate changes (like HTN operator effects) rather than just a single "success/failure" string outcome, for richer predictions and better integration with planning.
Scalability of Learned Rules: As the number of action_keys and context_keys grows, the rule-base could become very large and sparse. Abstraction, generalization, or more structured model representations will be needed.
5.11. DynamicSelfModel (DSM)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To maintain and dynamically update the agent's internal representation of itself. This "self-model" includes learned knowledge about its own capabilities (what actions it can perform effectively), limitations (actions or contexts where it tends to fail), identity traits (e.g., curiosity, persistence), meta-knowledge (such as validated or invalid file paths), and awareness of its recent internal affective and error states.
Cognitive Inspiration:
Self-Modeling / Self-Awareness (Metzinger, 2003): Provides a computational basis for the agent to have beliefs about its own properties, performance, and internal states, a prerequisite for more advanced self-awareness.
Meta-cognition (Flavell, 1979): Knowing one's own strengths and weaknesses is fundamental to meta-cognition. The DSM's tracking of capabilities and limitations directly supports this, enabling more informed decision-making and learning strategies.
Identity Formation (Rudimentary - McAdams, 2001): The periodic _perform_reflection method, which updates identity_traits based on patterns in action history (learning_events), is a rudimentary attempt to model how an agent's "personality" or behavioral tendencies might emerge from its history of interactions and learning.
Meta-Learning ("Learning to Learn"): The learning_rate_meta (identifying "fast_learner" and "slow_learner" action keys based on outcome consistency) allows the agent to learn about its own learning process for different types of tasks.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
DEFAULT_SELF_MODEL Structure: Defines the initial schema, including version, identity_traits (curiosity, caution, persistence, adaptability), capabilities (action_key -> confidence score), limitations (action_key -> confidence score), knowledge_meta (validated_paths, invalid_paths, learned_concepts), internal_state_awareness (last_valence, last_intensity, recent_error_types), learning_rate, and learning_rate_meta (fast/slow learner action keys).
Configuration (from config.toml [dynamic_self_model]): Model persistence path (from [agent_data_paths]), max_invalid_paths, learning_rate, learning_events_history_size, reflection_interval_cycles.
State Variables: self_model: Dict[str, Any] (the core model), learning_events: Deque[Dict[str, Any]] (history for reflection), cycles_since_reflection: int.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration, sets up model path, attempts to load existing model from JSON, and ensures default keys exist.
async def _load_model() / async def save_model(): Handle JSON persistence with atomic writes.
def _get_parameter_specific_suffix(action_type, params, result_data, error) -> str: Generates a suffix for action keys to make them more specific (e.g., :large_file for READ_FILE, :complex_prompt for CALL_LLM, _timeout_error for CALL_LLM if timeout).
async def _update_capability(action_key_for_update, outcome, params): Centralized logic to update confidence scores in self_model.capabilities and self_model.limitations for a given action_key_for_update. It now uses an effective_learning_rate adjusted by learning_rate_meta ("fast/slow learner" status of the action_key_for_update).
async def update_self_model(last_action_type, outcome, params, error, result_data, phenomenal_state): The primary learning method.
Capabilities/Limitations: Generates general (action:TYPE) and specific (action:TYPE:param_suffix) keys. Calls _update_capability for both to adjust confidence scores based on outcome. Low-confidence entries might be removed.
Path Knowledge: If last_action_type is a file operation, resolves the path involved (using AgentController.agent_root_path for relative paths). Updates knowledge_meta.validated_paths (adds/updates timestamp on success, removes from invalid) and knowledge_meta.invalid_paths (adds on specific path-related failures, removes from validated).
Internal State Awareness: Updates last_valence, last_intensity from phenomenal_state. Appends error_type to recent_error_types on failure.
Learning Event Recording: Appends details of the action, outcome, and specific key to learning_events. Increments cycles_since_reflection.
Periodic Reflection: If cycles_since_reflection >= reflection_interval, calls _perform_reflection().
Updates model version and last_update time if changes occurred.
async def _perform_reflection(): Analyzes learning_events history.
Updates identity_traits:
Adaptability: Influenced by diversity of action keys tried and overall success rate.
Curiosity: Influenced by the rate of trying actions not already in high-confidence capabilities.
Persistence: Refined calculation based on patterns of overcoming failures for specific action keys (failures followed by eventual success).
Caution: Influenced inversely by overall success rate.
Updates learning_rate_meta.capabilities: Identifies action_keys as "fast_learner" (highly consistent outcomes) or "slow_learner" (highly inconsistent outcomes) based on outcome patterns in learning_events.
Clears learning_events.
async def process(self, input_state): Extracts action context and phenomenal state from input_state and calls update_self_model.
async def get_capability_confidence(action_type, params) / async def get_limitations(action_type): Query interfaces.
Data Flow:
Inputs (to process from AgentController): last_action_type, action_outcome, action_params, action_error, action_result_data, current_phenomenal_state.
Outputs: Primarily updates its internal self.model. Its status (including capability/limitation counts, identity traits) is available via get_status() and is passed to EmergentMotivationSystem by the AgentController.
Key Algorithms: Confidence score updating (reinforcement-like), path knowledge management, sliding window history for learning events, pattern analysis in reflection (success rates, action diversity, outcome consistency).
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Influence of Identity Traits: Implementing mechanisms for the learned identity_traits to actively influence agent behavior (e.g., caution affecting risk assessment in ValueSystem or planner; curiosity boosting novelty preference in AttentionController).
Use of learning_rate_meta: Ensure the _update_capability method effectively uses the "fast/slow learner" information to modulate learning rates for specific actions.
Temporal Decay/Forgetting: Consider adding decay mechanisms for capability/limitation confidence scores or for validated_paths if not reconfirmed, to prevent overconfidence based on stale information.
Abstract Capabilities/Concepts: Developing mechanisms to learn more abstract capabilities or concepts beyond specific action keys (e.g., generalizing from READ_FILE:json and READ_FILE:xml to "proficient with structured data files"). This is a significant research area.

Section 5: Motivation, Narrative, and Loop Detection
This section details components responsible for the agent's internal drives, its autobiographical record, and its ability to detect and break out of unproductive behavioral patterns. These contribute to the agent's autonomy, sense of self over time, and operational robustness.
5.12. EmergentMotivationSystem (EMS)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To simulate and manage the agent's internal "drives" or intrinsic motivations, such as curiosity, satisfaction, and competence (and potentially purpose, though purpose in OSCAR-C is also managed as a distinct P/H/P state by the AgentController). These drives are updated based on the agent's experiences (action outcomes, goal progress, learning events, prediction errors, affective states) and can, in turn, influence other cognitive processes like attention, goal generation, and the affective coloring of experience.
Cognitive Inspiration:
Intrinsic Motivation Theories (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007): The EMS directly models drives that arise from the inherent interest or satisfaction in activities, rather than external rewards. This includes:
Curiosity: The drive to explore, discover, and understand, often triggered by novelty, uncertainty, or moderate prediction errors (Schmidhuber, 1991).
Competence/Effectance (White, 1959): The drive to become more effective in interacting with the environment and mastering skills.
Satisfaction: A sense of fulfillment derived from successful actions or goal achievement.
Homeostatic Principle (Implicit): Drive values tend to decay towards a neutral baseline (e.g., 0.5), reflecting a tendency to seek equilibrium. Deviations from this baseline create motivational pressure.
Influence of Affective States: The design incorporates the agent's overall "pain," "happiness," and "purpose" levels (managed by AgentController) as modulators for these drives, linking basic affective feedback to higher-level motivations.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
DEFAULT_DRIVES Structure: A dictionary defining default parameters for each drive (e.g., "curiosity," "satisfaction," "competence"). Each drive has:
value: Current level (0-1).
decay: Rate of decay towards a baseline (e.g., 0.5).
Gain/loss parameters: Factors for how specific events (e.g., gain_discovery, gain_prediction_error, loss_repetition for curiosity; gain_from_high_pain_for_distraction, gain_from_low_purpose_for_exploration for curiosity influenced by P/H/P states) adjust the drive value.
Configuration (from config.toml [emergent_motivation_system]): Allows overriding default drive parameters. Includes ems_cs_history_maxlen, ems_low_cs_persistence_threshold, ems_low_cs_curiosity_boost_factor for CS-influenced curiosity boosts.
State Variables:
drives: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]: Holds the current state of all drives.
_kb: Optional[KnowledgeBase]: Reference to KnowledgeBase for querying recent action history.
_last_self_model_summary: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: Stores previous DynamicSelfModel status to detect changes in capabilities.
recent_cs_levels_ems: Deque[str]: History of recent ConsciousState level names for detecting persistent low CS.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads drive parameters from config, merging with DEFAULT_DRIVES. Stores reference to KnowledgeBase. Initializes CS history parameters and deque.
async def _get_recent_action_history(self, window_size) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]: Queries KnowledgeBase for recent eventOccurred("actionExecution", ...) predicates, filters out "THINKING" actions, sorts by timestamp, and returns the window_size most recent.
async def evaluate_intrinsic_motivation(self, cognitive_state, last_action_result, phenomenal_state, active_goal, self_model_summary) -> Dict[str, float]: The core drive update logic.
Consciousness State History: Updates recent_cs_levels_ems with the current consciousness_level from cognitive_state. Checks if ConsciousState has been persistently low (below CONSCIOUS) based on ems_low_cs_persistence_threshold.
Contextual Information Extraction:
Calculates historical_success_rate from _get_recent_action_history().
Determines competence_change_signal (+1, 0, or -1) by comparing current self_model_summary (from DynamicSelfModel status) with _last_self_model_summary to detect net changes in capabilities vs. limitations.
Retrieves last_prediction_error from PredictiveWorldModel (via controller). If it's an outcome_mismatch, extracts/calculates prediction_error_magnitude (0-1).
Extracts current pain_level, happiness_level, purpose_level from cognitive_state.
Drive Update Loop: For each drive (curiosity, satisfaction, competence):
Decay: Applies decay: new_value = current_value + decay_param * (0.5 - current_value).
Curiosity:
Increases on successful "discovery" actions (EXPLORE, READ_FILE, etc.).
Increases proportionally to prediction_error_magnitude.
Increases if ConsciousState was persistently low (using low_cs_curiosity_boost_factor).
Increases if pain_level is very high (parameter gain_from_high_pain_for_distraction and threshold_high_pain_for_curiosity).
Increases if purpose_level is very low (parameter gain_from_low_purpose_for_exploration and threshold_low_purpose_for_curiosity).
Satisfaction:
Increases/decreases based on historical_success_rate deviation from 0.5.
Increases significantly if active_goal.status is ACHIEVED.
Decreases significantly if active_goal.status is FAILED.
Decreases based on pain_level (parameter loss_from_pain_factor).
Adjusts based on happiness_level deviation from its baseline (parameter gain_from_happiness_factor).
Competence:
Increases if competence_change_signal > 0 (more capabilities learned in DSM).
Decreases if competence_change_signal < 0 (more limitations learned in DSM).
Increases/decreases based on historical_success_rate deviation from 0.5.
Increases if purpose_level is low (parameter gain_from_low_purpose_for_efficacy and threshold_low_purpose_for_competence).
Clamps new_value for each drive between 0.0 and 1.0.
Updates _last_self_model_summary. Returns a dictionary of current drive values.
async def process(self, input_state): Extracts context from input_state and calls evaluate_intrinsic_motivation. Returns {"drive_values": ...}.
Data Flow:
Inputs (to process from AgentController): cognitive_state (includes CS level, P/H/P), last_action_result, phenomenal_state (less used currently), active_goal, self_model_summary (from DSM). Implicitly uses KnowledgeBase (for action history) and PredictiveWorldModel (for last_prediction_error).
Outputs (to AgentController): {"drive_values": Dict[str, float]}.
Key Algorithms: Weighted gain/loss updates with decay, sliding window history analysis (via KB), change detection (for DSM summary).
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Goal Generation Link: The EMS currently updates drives, but the AgentController's logic for generating goals based on these drives is very basic (only default "Observe and learn" based on curiosity). A more sophisticated GoalGenerator component or enhanced controller logic is needed to translate diverse drive states into specific intrinsic goals.
Influence on Action Selection: The direct influence of drives on HTNPlanner's method selection or AgentController's action choice (beyond default goal generation) is not yet explicit.
loss_repetition for Curiosity: The loss_repetition parameter for curiosity is defined but not yet used. This would require input from LoopDetector or analysis of action/state repetition.
Complex Drive Interactions: Modeling more complex interactions between drives (e.g., high frustration from low satisfaction suppressing curiosity, or specific drive profiles leading to distinct "moods").
5.13. NarrativeConstructor (NC)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To create and maintain an autobiographical narrative for the agent by identifying "significant" events or state changes and generating first-person textual entries that describe or reflect upon them. This contributes to a rudimentary form of self-identity, memory integration, and provides a basis for future self-reflection.
Cognitive Inspiration:
Narrative Identity & Autobiographical Memory (Bruner, 1991; McAdams, 2001; Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000): Humans make sense of their lives by constructing stories. The NC attempts to model this, creating a temporal log of subjectively important experiences.
Self-Awareness and Reflection: The act of narrating can be a form of reflection, allowing the agent to "comment" on its own activities and internal states.
Language and Thought: Utilizing an LLM for narrative generation explores the link between linguistic representation and the refinement of understanding or experience.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
NarrativeEntry(dataclass): Stores timestamp, content (textual narrative), triggering_event (summary), phenomenal_state_summary, consciousness_level (name), drive_state.
Configuration (from config.toml [narrative_constructor]): max_length (for narrative deque), significance thresholds (valence_change_threshold, intensity_threshold, drive_change_threshold, general significance_threshold, new P/H/P change thresholds), save_interval_s, LLM parameters (llm_model_name, llm_temperature, llm_timeout_s). Path for narrative log from [agent_data_paths].
State Variables: narrative: Deque[NarrativeEntry], _narrative_path, _last_save_time, _last_phenomenal_state, _last_drive_state, _last_pain_level_nc, _last_happiness_level_nc, _last_purpose_level_nc, _known_pain_source_ids_nc.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration, sets up path, loads existing narrative log, initializes last known P/H/P/drive states from controller/EMS. Stores references to KnowledgeBase and Predicate class for future KB interaction.
async def _load_narrative() / async def save_narrative(force=False): Handle JSON Lines persistence of the narrative deque.
def _is_significant(current_phenomenal_state, last_action_result, loop_info, meta_analysis, prediction_error, current_drives) -> Tuple[bool, str, Dict[str, Any]]: Determines if an event warrants narration based on:
Significant changes in PhenomenalState.valence or high intensity.
Goal achievement/failure.
Failure of non-"THINKING" actions or success of "discovery"/"communication" actions.
Detection of loop_info or issues_detected by MetaCognitiveMonitor.
Change in AgentController.consciousness_level.
Presence of a prediction_error.
drive_shift (calculated by _calculate_drive_shift) exceeding threshold.
Significant changes in agent's P/H/P levels exceeding respective thresholds.
Detection of new or resolved PainSource events.
Updates last known P/H/P/drive/phenomenal states. Returns (is_significant_bool, reason_string, event_summary_dict).
async def generate_narrative_entry(phenomenal_state, triggering_event, reason) -> str:
Prompt Engineering: Constructs a detailed prompt for an LLM (call_ollama via external_comms). The prompt includes:
A system message instructing the LLM to write a reflective, first-person entry, with varying depth based on the agent's current ConsciousState (deeper reflection for META_CONSCIOUS/REFLECTIVE).
Current agent state: ConsciousState, drive_state, P/H/P levels, phenomenal_state summary.
Summary of the triggering_event and reason.
Analysis hints if triggered by prediction error or drive shift.
Snippets of previous narrative entries for context.
LLM Call: Invokes call_ollama.
Fallback: Provides a template message if LLM fails.
Returns the generated (or fallback) narrative string.
async def process(self, input_state):
Extracts phenomenal_state, last_action_result, loop_info, meta_analysis, prediction_error from input_state. Retrieves current_drives from EmergentMotivationSystem.
Calls _is_significant.
If significant, calls generate_narrative_entry, creates a NarrativeEntry object, appends it to self.narrative.
Asserts Narrative Summary to KB: If _kb and _PredicateClass are available, creates and asserts summary predicates to KnowledgeBase (e.g., narrativeEventRecorded(timestamp, reason, cs_level), narrativeAssociatedValence(timestamp, valence), narrativeTriggerType(timestamp, type)).
Calls save_narrative().
Data Flow:
Inputs (to process from AgentController): phenomenal_state, last_action_result, loop_info, meta_analysis, prediction_error. Implicitly accesses current_drives (from EMS via controller), consciousness_level, and P/H/P states (from AgentController).
Outputs: Primarily updates its internal narrative deque and saves to file. Asserts summary predicates to KnowledgeBase. Does not directly output data into the main cycle flow for immediate use by the next step.
Key Algorithms: Threshold-based significance detection, LLM-based text generation via prompt engineering.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Narrative Coherence & Grounding: Ensuring long-term narrative coherence and grounding LLM-generated content against facts in KnowledgeBase to mitigate confabulation.
Internal Use of Narrative: Enabling the agent to actively query, reflect upon, and learn from its own narrative content (e.g., for DynamicSelfModel updates, MetaCognitiveMonitor analysis, or providing context for HTNPlanner).
Prompt Evolution: Continuously refining LLM prompts for higher quality, more insightful, and state-reflective narrative entries.
Thematic Analysis: Implementing mechanisms (potentially LLM-based) to analyze the narrative log for recurring themes, emotional trends, or unresolved issues.
5.14. LoopDetector
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To monitor the agent's recent action history to identify potentially unproductive behavioral loops, such as repeating the exact same action multiple times consecutively or performing a single type of action with unusually high frequency within a short window.
Cognitive Inspiration: Addresses the problem of perseveration—the pathological repetition of a response—which is a sign of cognitive inflexibility. Healthy cognitive systems can detect when a strategy is failing and switch (Norman & Shallice, 1986, on Supervisory Attentional System).
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [loop_detection]):
window_size: Number of recent actions to analyze (dynamically read from AgentController.config per detection).
max_consecutive_actions: Threshold for consecutive identical action loop.
frequency_threshold: If frequency of most common action in window exceeds this (0-1), flag.
ignore_thinking_actions: Boolean, if THINKING actions should be excluded from analysis.
State Variables: _kb: Optional[KnowledgeBase] (reference to query action history).
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration, validates parameters. Stores reference to KnowledgeBase.
async def detect_loops(self) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
Dynamic Window Size: Reads window_size from AgentController.config.loop_detection.
Query Action History: Queries _kb.query_state({"recent_facts": fetch_count}) for eventOccurred("actionExecution", ...) predicates. fetch_count is adjusted based on window_size and ignore_thinking_actions.
Filter & Window: Filters out "THINKING" actions if ignore_thinking_actions is true. Takes the most recent effective_window_size actions.
Consecutive Action Loop Check: If len(recent_actions) >= max_consecutive_actions, checks if the last max_consecutive_actions have the same type. If so, returns loop_info.
High-Frequency Action Loop Check: If enough actions in window, uses collections.Counter for action type frequencies. If most common action's frequency exceeds frequency_threshold and its count meets a minimum, returns loop_info.
Returns None if no loop detected.
async def process(self, input_state): Calls detect_loops(). Returns {"loop_info": loop_info_result}.
Data Flow:
Inputs: Implicitly uses KnowledgeBase (via AgentController).
Outputs (to AgentController): {"loop_info": Optional[Dict[str, Any]]}.
Key Algorithms: Sliding window analysis (via KB query), consecutive sequence detection, frequency analysis (collections.Counter).
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Complex Loop Patterns: Current detection is for simple repetitions. Enhancements include detecting alternating sequences (A-B-A-B) or state-action loops (same action in same state).
Parameter-Aware Loops: Considering action parameters, not just types.
Learned Loop Signatures: Learning specific action sequences that historically led to unproductive outcomes.

Section 6: Meta-Cognition, Performance, and Error Management
This section covers components responsible for higher-level oversight of the agent's functioning, including monitoring cognitive processes, optimizing performance, and handling runtime errors. These are crucial for robustness, adaptability, and long-term operational stability.
5.15. MetaCognitiveMonitor (MCM)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To serve as the agent's primary internal observer and critic of its own cognitive processes. It analyzes the agent's overall cognitive_state (including goal progress, consciousness levels, action outcomes, affective P/H/P states) and performance_metrics to detect anomalies, inefficiencies, or problematic patterns. Its output (meta_analysis) can inform interventions or strategic adjustments by the AgentController.
Cognitive Inspiration: Directly embodies meta-cognition—the capacity to monitor, evaluate, and regulate one's own thought processes (Flavell, 1979; Nelson & Narens, 1990). Effective meta-cognition is essential for learning from mistakes, adapting strategies when current ones are failing, and achieving higher levels of self-awareness and control (e.g., "C2" consciousness in Dehaene's model).
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [meta_cognition]):
stagnation_threshold_s: Time after which an active goal with a high failure rate is flagged.
failure_rate_threshold: The failure rate (0-1) threshold for flagging a stagnating goal.
low_consciousness_threshold_s: Duration for which ConsciousState can remain below CONSCIOUS before flagging.
history_size: Number of recent ConsciousState levels to store for analysis.
reflection_trigger_frequency_cycles: (Conceptual, influences DSM reflection rather than direct MCM action).
State Variables:
recent_consciousness_levels: Deque[Tuple[float, ConsciousState]]: History of (timestamp, ConsciousState) tuples.
_kb: Optional[KnowledgeBase]: Reference for querying action history related to goals.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration, initializes history deques. Stores reference to KnowledgeBase.
async def monitor_cognition(self, cognitive_state, performance_metrics) -> Dict[str, Any]: The core analysis method.
Update History: Appends current consciousness_level (from cognitive_state) to recent_consciousness_levels.
Goal Stagnation Check:
Retrieves active_goal from AgentController.
If active_goal is ACTIVE and its age exceeds stagnation_threshold_s:
Queries KnowledgeBase (if available) for eventOccurred("actionExecution", ...) predicates related to this goal's lifetime.
Calculates actual_failure_rate for these actions.
If actual_failure_rate > failure_rate_threshold (or if no actions recorded for an old goal), flags goal_stagnation in issues_detected.
Persistent Low Consciousness Check: If agent has been below ConsciousState.CONSCIOUS for a duration exceeding low_consciousness_threshold_s (based on recent_consciousness_levels), flags low_consciousness.
Performance Bottleneck Check (Basic): If avg_cycle_time from performance_metrics significantly exceeds target_cycle_time, flags performance_bottleneck.
Meta-Conscious State Active Check: If cognitive_state.consciousness_level is META_CONSCIOUS, logs this as a notable state.
Output: Returns an analysis dictionary: {"timestamp": ..., "issues_detected": List[Dict], "suggestions": List[str], "confidence": float}. Suggestions are currently simple strings (e.g., "review_goal_viability").
async def process(self, input_state): Extracts cognitive_state and performance_metrics from input_state. Calls monitor_cognition. Returns {"meta_analysis": analysis_result}.
Data Flow:
Inputs (from AgentController): cognitive_state (aggregated by AgentController), performance_metrics (from CycleProfiler). Implicitly uses KnowledgeBase.
Outputs (to AgentController): {"meta_analysis": Dict[str, Any]}.
Key Algorithms: Sliding window history analysis, thresholding, rate calculation from KB queries.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Actionable and Structured Suggestions (Phase III): Evolve suggestions from simple strings to structured commands that the AgentController or other components can directly interpret and act upon (e.g., {"type": "INITIATE_REFLECTION", "topic": "goal_stagnation", "goal_id": "..."}).
Deeper Analysis (Phase III):
Integrate analysis of DynamicSelfModel's confidence scores. For example, flag if the agent is persistently attempting actions for which its DynamicSelfModel indicates low capability, especially if these actions are part of a stagnating goal.
Analyze NarrativeConstructor summary predicates stored in the KnowledgeBase to detect recurring negative emotional themes, unresolved issues, or inconsistencies in the agent's autobiographical record.
Learning Meta-Cognitive Heuristics: Explore mechanisms for the MCM to learn or adapt its own detection thresholds and intervention suggestion policies based on the long-term effectiveness of its past analyses and the agent's overall success.
Proactive Meta-cognition: Shift from purely reactive detection of existing problems towards more proactive identification of potential future issues based on trend analysis or subtle patterns in cognitive state.
5.16. PerformanceOptimizer (PO)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To monitor the computational performance of the agent's cognitive cycle, analyze timing data for each step, identify performance bottlenecks (where components exceed their allocated time), assess overall system "computational health," and suggest or record adjustments to configuration parameters of other components to improve efficiency.
Cognitive Inspiration: Analogous to an organism's ability to manage its energy expenditure and optimize effort for cognitive tasks. If thinking becomes too "slow" or certain mental operations are consistently resource-intensive, a biological system might adapt its processing strategy or reduce cognitive load. The PO implements a form of meta-cognitive regulation focused on processing efficiency.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml):
[performance_optimizer]: history_size (for cycle profiles), auto_apply_adjustments (boolean, if true, PO merges suggestions into its persisted config_changes), cycle_thresholds_s (dictionary mapping profiler section names like "planning" to target maximum durations).
[performance]: target_cycle_time.
Path for performance_adjustments.json from [agent_data_paths].
State Variables:
cycle_history: Deque[Dict[str, float]]: Stores recent cycle profiles.
optimization_thresholds: Dict[str, float]: Effective thresholds for bottleneck detection.
config_changes: Dict[str, Any]: Stores suggested/applied parameter adjustments for other components, loaded from and persisted to performance_adjustments.json.
_target_cycle_time: float.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration, sets up path for performance_adjustments.json, and loads any previously persisted adjustments into self.config_changes.
async def process(self, input_state):
Input: {"cycle_profile": Dict[str, float]}.
Updates cycle_history. Calculates current_health_score using _assess_health().
Bottleneck Identification: Identifies components in cycle_profile exceeding their base_threshold from optimization_thresholds.
Adjustment Generation (_generate_adjustments): If bottlenecks, generates suggested_adjustments. Current logic targets:
planning bottleneck: Suggests reducing performance.max_planning_depth.
attention bottleneck: Suggests reducing attention_controller.max_candidates.
workspace bottleneck: Suggests reducing global_workspace.capacity.
loop_detection bottleneck: Suggests reducing loop_detection.window_size.
It reads current values from AgentController.config (potentially overridden by self.config_changes) to calculate new suggestions.
Applying Adjustments (_apply_and_persist_adjustments): If auto_apply_adjustments is true and suggestions exist, merges them into self.config_changes and saves to performance_adjustments.json.
Recovery Suggestion (_suggest_recovery_mode): Based on current_health_score, suggests a RecoveryMode.
Returns performance_analysis dictionary (bottlenecks, health, suggestions, applied changes, recovery mode).
def _assess_health(self) -> float: Calculates health (0-1) as target_cycle_time / average_recent_cycle_time.
def _suggest_recovery_mode(self, health_score) -> Optional[RecoveryMode]: Threshold-based: health < 0.1 -> HARD_RESET, < 0.2 -> MEDIUM_RESET, < HEALTH_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD (0.3) -> SOFT_RESET.
Data Flow & Influence:
Inputs (from AgentController): cycle_profile. Implicitly accesses AgentController.config.
Outputs (to AgentController): performance_analysis dictionary.
Influence: AgentController reads active_config_adjustments from PO.get_status() (which is PO.self.config_changes) and updates its own live self.config. Components like HTNPlanner, AttentionController, GlobalWorkspaceManager, and LoopDetector are designed to read some of their operational parameters from this live AgentController.config at the start of their processing steps, thus enacting the dynamic adjustments. If PO suggests a RecoveryMode, AgentController acts on it.
Key Algorithms: Sliding window averaging, threshold-based bottleneck detection, rule-based parameter adjustment, JSON persistence.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Smarter Adjustment Generation: Current adjustment rules are simple. Future work includes more sophisticated heuristics, considering parameter interactions, or even simple learning mechanisms (e.g., hill-climbing based on health feedback).
Broader Component Impact: Extend adjustment logic to more components and parameters (Task B.X.1).
Contextual Optimization: Optimization strategies could vary based on ConsciousState, active task, or MetaCognitiveMonitor feedback (e.g., prioritize stability over speed during critical tasks).
Safety Limits for Adjustments: Ensure PO's suggestions stay within predefined safe operational bounds for all tunable parameters to prevent destabilization.
5.17. ErrorRecoverySystem (ERS)
Protocol Conformance: CognitiveComponent.
Purpose and Cognitive Inspiration:
Purpose: To provide a centralized system for handling runtime exceptions that occur during the agent's operation. It logs errors, analyzes their type and frequency, and suggests an appropriate RecoveryMode to the AgentController, enabling graceful recovery and maintaining system stability.
Cognitive Inspiration: Models fault tolerance and resilience mechanisms found in robust systems. The graded response to errors (different RecoveryModes) is analogous to how biological systems might react differently to minor versus severe disruptions.
Proposed Design and Implementation:
Configuration (from config.toml [error_recovery]): max_history (for error_history), freq_window (recent errors for frequency analysis), freq_threshold (count threshold for escalating recovery).
State Variables:
error_history: Deque[Dict[str, Any]]: Stores records of recent errors (timestamp, type, message, context, suggested recovery).
recovery_strategies: Dict[type, Callable]: Maps Python exception types (e.g., MemoryError, TimeoutError, Exception) to "suggester" functions that return a RecoveryMode.
Core Methods:
async def initialize(self, config, controller): Loads configuration. Populates recovery_strategies with handlers for common Python exceptions, mapping them to appropriate default RecoveryModes (e.g., MemoryError -> MEDIUM_RESET, TimeoutError -> SOFT_RESET). The generic Exception maps to _suggest_generic_recovery.
async def handle_error(self, error: Exception, context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Optional[RecoveryMode]: The primary interface called by AgentController.
Logs detailed error information (type, message, context) and a concise version to the UI.
Appends an error record to error_history.
Selects a recovery suggester function using _get_recovery_suggester(error) based on the error's type.
Invokes the suggester. Updates the error record with the suggested recovery mode (name).
Returns the RecoveryMode enum member (or None).
def _get_recovery_suggester(self, error: Exception) -> Callable: Returns the most specific suggester for the error type, falling back to _suggest_generic_recovery.
def _suggest_generic_recovery(self, error: Exception, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[RecoveryMode]: Fallback for unmapped exceptions. Checks error frequency (_check_error_frequency) and escalates recovery: SOFT -> MEDIUM -> HARD_RESET if frequency exceeds thresholds.
def _check_error_frequency(self, error_type_name: str) -> int: Counts occurrences of error_type_name in the freq_window of error_history.
async def process(self, input_state): No-op; ERS is reactive.
Data Flow & Influence:
Inputs (to handle_error from AgentController): error: Exception, context: Dict (agent state at error).
Outputs (from handle_error to AgentController): Optional[RecoveryMode].
Influence: AgentController calls _oscar_handle_recovery(suggested_mode) to implement the recovery actions.
Key Algorithms: Type-based dispatch (strategy pattern), frequency analysis with sliding window, threshold-based escalation.
Anticipated Challenges & Refinements:
Context-Aware Recovery: Enhance suggesters to use context more deeply for tailored recovery advice (e.g., a TimeoutError during CALL_LLM might suggest retrying with a longer timeout for that LLM, rather than a generic SOFT_RESET).
Learning Recovery Effectiveness: Track success of different RecoveryModes for specific errors/contexts to learn more effective strategies over time.
User-Defined Error Handlers: Allow defining custom error handling strategies in config.toml for application-specific exceptions.

Part 6: Advanced Cognitive Capabilities and Architectural Extensions
Beyond the core cognitive cycle and component functionalities, the OSCAR-C architecture is designed to be a platform for exploring more sophisticated aspects of intelligence and consciousness-like behaviors. This section discusses several key areas for advanced development and research, outlining theoretical considerations and potential implementation strategies. These extensions aim to enhance the agent's understanding of its environment, its own internal processes, and its ability to interact in more complex and nuanced ways.
6.1. Temporal Awareness and Processing
A mature cognitive system requires a sophisticated understanding and representation of time, encompassing the awareness of duration, the sequencing of events, temporal relationships between past, present, and future states, and the ability to reason about time in processes like planning and prediction.
Theoretical Basis:
Episodic Memory (Tulving, 1972, 2002): The ability to recall specific past events, not just as isolated facts but as experiences situated in a particular temporal and spatial context. This involves a sense of "autonoetic consciousness" or self-awareness in time.
Mental Time Travel (Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997, 2007): The capacity to mentally project oneself into the past (to re-experience or reflect upon events) and into the future (to anticipate, plan, or simulate potential outcomes).
Temporal Logic and Reasoning (Prior, 1957; Allen, 1983): Formal systems for representing and reasoning about propositions qualified in terms of time, including concepts like tense (past, present, future), temporal intervals, and relationships (e.g., before, after, during, overlaps).
Proposed OSCAR-C Enhancements:
Timestamping (Existing Foundation): All core data structures (Predicate, PhenomenalState, NarrativeEntry, action records within KnowledgeBase) already include precise time.time() timestamps. This provides the raw data for temporal reasoning.
KnowledgeBase Temporal Queries (Phase III Task):
Enhance KnowledgeBase.query or add new methods (e.g., query_temporal_predicates) to support queries based on time intervals. This would allow retrieval of predicates that were true or asserted during a specific period (e.g., SELECT * FROM predicates WHERE name = 'X' AND timestamp >= T_start AND timestamp <= T_end).
Support queries for sequences of events (e.g., "find all occurrences of event A followed by event B within D seconds"). This might require more complex SQL or post-processing of timestamped event predicates.
Narrative Constructor and Temporal Coherence:
Enhance the NarrativeConstructor to explicitly reason about the temporal flow and duration between significant events when generating narrative entries. Prompts to the LLM could include instructions to reflect on temporal aspects ("It had been a long time since X...", "Shortly after Y occurred...").
The narrative itself, being temporally ordered, provides a rich source for future temporal reflection.
HTNPlanner Temporal Extensions (Phase III Task):
Add a duration: float attribute to Operator dataclasses, representing the estimated time an operator takes to execute.
Modify HTNPlanner._calculate_method_heuristic_cost to sum operator durations for a simple plan execution time estimate, potentially biasing towards shorter-duration plans.
(Advanced) Introduce temporal constraints within Method preconditions or subtask definitions (e.g., "subtask_A must_finish_before subtask_B_starts," "predicate P must_hold_for D duration"). The _decompose algorithm would need to manage a simple timeline or use temporal constraint satisfaction techniques.
PredictiveWorldModel Time-Bound Predictions (Phase III Task):
Modify PredictiveWorldModel.predict_next_state to return not just the predicted_outcome but also an estimated predicted_time_to_outcome (e.g., in agent cycles or seconds).
The update_model method would learn these temporal dynamics by observing the actual time taken for outcomes to manifest.
ExperienceStream and the "Specious Present":
Enhance PhenomenalState or ExperienceStream's integration logic to more explicitly represent a brief temporal window—the "specious present" (James, 1890)—by integrating content not just from the current instant but also from immediately preceding states in a structured, decaying manner. This could involve a short-term buffer within ExperienceStream.
Dedicated Time Reasoning Module (Optional, Advanced): For highly sophisticated temporal reasoning (e.g., managing complex timelines, resolving temporal paradoxes, or performing detailed interval logic), a dedicated "Temporal Reasoning Module" could be introduced. This module would maintain a structured timeline of key events and their temporal relationships, accessible by other components.
6.2. Peripheral Interactions and Simulated Embodiment
To develop a more grounded understanding and to explore principles of embodied cognition, OSCAR-C can be extended to interact with external (simulated or physical) peripheries. This includes processing novel sensory inputs and even rudimentary aversive stimuli.
Theoretical Basis:
Embodied Cognition (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991; Clark, 1997): Argues that cognitive processes are deeply intertwined with an agent's physical body and its dynamic sensorimotor interactions with the environment. "Intelligence develops through interaction with the world."
Pain as a Homeostatic and Motivational Signal (Fields, 2004; Craig, 2003): Pain is not merely a sensation but a powerful affective and motivational state that signals potential harm, drives protective behaviors, and modulates learning.
Sensory Grounding (Harnad, 1990): The idea that symbolic representations must ultimately be grounded in sensory experiences to have intrinsic meaning.
Proposed OSCAR-C Enhancements (Phase IV / Experimental):
Asynchronous I/O Handler: A dedicated, separate Python thread or asyncio task will be implemented to manage low-level communication with a chosen peripheral device (e.g., an Arduino or similar microcontroller connected via USB serial, or a virtual device interface). This handler will:
Continuously read data from input channels (e.g., rotary encoder, buttons, virtual sensors).
Translate raw sensor values into a structured format (e.g., {"sensor_id": "pain_encoder", "raw_value": 150, "processed_value": 0.75}).
Place this structured sensor data onto an input queue accessible by AgentController._oscar_perceive().
Listen on an output queue for commands from the agent (e.g., text to display on a small screen, LED control signals) and send them to the peripheral.
Simulated "Pain" Input:
A specific sensor input (e.g., a rotary encoder value exceeding a threshold, or a dedicated input signal) will be designated as a "pain" signal.
The I/O handler or _oscar_perceive will process this into a pain_level (e.g., normalized 0-1).
Perception Update (AgentController._oscar_perceive()):
Will read from the sensor input queue in a non-blocking manner.
Sensor data (e.g., {"sensor": "rotary_encoder_pain", "value": 0.75}) will be added to raw_percepts under a key like external_stimuli.
KnowledgeBase Representation for Pain:
The AgentController (or ExperienceStream) will translate the pain_level percept into Predicates asserted into the KnowledgeBase, e.g.:
Predicate("isSensing", ("pain", pain_category), True) where pain_category is "low," "medium," or "high."
Predicate("painIntensity", (pain_level_float,), True).
Integration of "Pain" into the Cognitive Cycle:
AttentionController: Pain-related predicates or raw pain percepts will be given a high intrinsic weight_hint or a strong "surprise" score if unexpected, ensuring they are rapidly attended to and enter the GlobalWorkspaceManager.
ExperienceStream: The pain_level will directly and significantly impact PhenomenalState.valence (making it negative) and potentially increase PhenomenalState.intensity. This is where the explicit link to the agent's P/H/P system's pain_level occurs, allowing external pain to feed into the internal affective state.
EmergentMotivationSystem: High pain_level will drastically reduce the "satisfaction" drive and could activate or strongly boost a specific "avoid_pain" or "seek_relief" drive.
HTNPlanner: High-priority methods will be designed to be triggered by pain predicates (e.g., isSensing(pain, high)). These methods would generate plans aimed at reducing the pain signal (e.g., if the agent can perform an action that influences the sensor, or generate a communication requesting intervention).
DynamicSelfModel: Repeated "pain" associated with certain actions or environmental states could lead to the agent learning new limitations or aversions related to those stimuli or actions.
NarrativeConstructor: Painful experiences (high pain_level, or the onset of pain) will be highly significant events, triggering detailed narrative entries.
Output to Peripherals: Actions defined in _oscar_execute_action (e.g., DISPLAY_ON_SCREEN(text)) will place messages onto the I/O handler's output queue for display on a connected device.
6.3. Controlled Non-Determinism ("Chaos") for Novelty and Emergence
While deterministic processing is essential for reliability, true intelligence often exhibits elements of exploration, creativity, and the ability to break out of rigid patterns. Introducing controlled non-determinism or "chaos" can help OSCAR-C escape local optima, discover novel solutions, and exhibit more emergent, less predictable behaviors.
Theoretical Basis:
Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off (Sutton & Barto, 2018): A fundamental concept in learning and decision-making. Occasional exploratory (seemingly random or suboptimal) choices can lead to the discovery of better long-term strategies.
Creativity and Divergent Thinking (Guilford, 1967): Often involves breaking established patterns, making unusual connections, and exploring a wider solution space.
Stochasticity in Neural Systems: Biological nervous systems are inherently noisy and probabilistic, which can contribute to flexibility, learning, and avoiding getting stuck in ruts.
Proposed OSCAR-C Implementation Strategies (Phase IV):
LLM Temperature Modulation:
For components using LLMs (NarrativeConstructor, LLM-assisted goal mapping or planning), the temperature parameter (which controls randomness of output) can be dynamically adjusted.
The MetaCognitiveMonitor or PerformanceOptimizer could suggest increasing temperature if the agent is stuck (e.g., goal stagnation, repetitive loops) to encourage novel ideas or narrative framings. Conversely, temperature could be lowered for tasks requiring high precision or factual recall.
Stochasticity in Attention (AttentionController):
Add a small random noise component to the calculated attention weights before normalization. The magnitude of this noise could be modulated by ConsciousState or drive levels (e.g., higher noise/exploration if curiosity drive is high or if satisfaction is very low and agent is stuck).
Implement probabilistic selection among top-N candidates if their attention weights are very close, rather than always picking the absolute highest.
Stochasticity in Planning (HTNPlanner):
If multiple methods are applicable for a task and have similar heuristic scores, select one probabilistically (e.g., epsilon-greedy, where epsilon is the probability of choosing a random applicable method) rather than always the first one in the sorted list.
Introduce "exploratory operators" with inherently uncertain or broad effects, and allow the planner to choose them occasionally, especially if curiosity is high or current plans are failing.
Modulation by Agent State: The degree of randomness or exploration introduced could be modulated by the agent's overall state:
Higher randomness/exploration if intrinsic drives (like curiosity) are high or if satisfaction/purpose are critically low (indicating current strategies are not working).
Lower randomness if the agent is in a CONSCIOUS or META_CONSCIOUS state focused on a high-priority goal requiring precise execution.
Higher randomness if ConsciousState is persistently UNCONSCIOUS (to try and "kickstart" more varied processing).
Noise Injection into Internal States (Experimental):
Carefully introduce small, random perturbations to certain internal state variables (e.g., drive levels, confidence scores in DynamicSelfModel, thresholds in AttentionController or GlobalWorkspaceManager). This must be done with extreme caution to avoid destabilizing the system, but could prevent it from settling into overly stable but suboptimal fixed points.
6.4. Operating System Integration (Long-Term Research)
For OSCAR-C to achieve a deeper level of "digital embodiment" and utility, direct interaction with its host operating system (OS) is a significant long-term research goal. This would allow it to perceive and act upon files, applications, and system resources in a more comprehensive manner. This endeavor carries substantial safety and ethical considerations.
Theoretical Rationale: Provides a rich, dynamic environment for grounded learning of complex skills and concepts related to digital interaction, resource management, and task automation.
Phased Approach (Conceptual, as detailed in "OSCAR-C Project Documentation (Full System Embodiment).txt"):
Phase X.1 (Restricted OS Interaction Layer): Implement new, highly sandboxed action types in _oscar_execute_action (e.g., EXECUTE_COMMAND from an allow-list, LAUNCH_APPLICATION for specific apps) and provide limited OS state information as percepts.
Phase X.2 (Learning Basic OS Navigation): Develop HTNPlanner methods/operators for simple OS tasks; use RL or imitation learning for skill acquisition.
Phase X.3 (Advanced OS Interaction): Enable more complex, multi-application task automation, requiring sophisticated perception (e.g., GUI understanding), more abstract actions, and robust ValueSystem oversight.
Key Technologies: GUI automation libraries (e.g., pyautogui), process management (psutil, subprocess), screen OCR (pytesseract), sandboxing/virtualization, OS accessibility APIs.
Safety and Ethics: Paramount. Requires strict allow-listing, resource limits, fine-grained permission models, robust ValueSystem constraints, and human oversight, especially in early stages.
These advanced extensions, building upon the core OSCAR-C architecture, aim to push the boundaries of AI capabilities towards more autonomous, adaptive, and potentially more "aware" systems. Each represents a significant research and development effort, requiring careful design, implementation, and empirical evaluation.

Part 7: Auxiliary Systems, Development Environment, and Operationalization
The successful development, operation, and maintenance of a complex cognitive architecture like OSCAR-C depend not only on its core cognitive components but also on a robust suite of auxiliary systems, a well-defined development environment, and clear operationalization procedures. This part outlines these supporting elements.
7.1. Configuration Management
Centralized and flexible configuration is essential for tuning agent behavior, managing experimental setups, and adapting the system to different environments or tasks without modifying core code.
config.toml:
Purpose: The primary configuration file for the OSCAR-C agent. It utilizes the TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format for its human-readable syntax and ease of parsing.
Structure: Organized into sections, typically corresponding to global agent settings (e.g., [agent], [performance], [agent_data_paths]) or settings for individual cognitive components (e.g., [attention_controller], [htn_planner], [internal_states]). Each section contains key-value pairs defining parameters, thresholds, paths, feature flags, and operational settings.
Key Parameters Managed (Examples):
Filesystem interaction limits (max_list_items, max_read_chars, allow_file_write).
Agent operational parameters (pid_file_name, default goal settings, failure count limits).
Paths for persistent data (kb_db_path, narrative_log_path, self_model_path, etc., centralized under [agent_data_paths]).
Global Workspace settings (capacity, broadcast_threshold).
AttentionController weights and operational parameters.
ConsciousnessLevelAssessor thresholds and Φ-Proxy weights.
Performance targets (target_cycle_time) and component-specific thresholds for PerformanceOptimizer.
LoopDetector settings (window_size, thresholds).
Parameters for all cognitive components, including DynamicSelfModel learning rates, EmergentMotivationSystem drive dynamics, NarrativeConstructor significance/LLM settings, PredictiveWorldModel learning/saving intervals, ValueSystem evaluation thresholds.
Parameters for the internal affective states (Pain, Happiness, Purpose).
LLM settings (default timeouts, temperatures).
Loading and Usage: The AgentController loads config.toml during its initialization. The full configuration dictionary (or relevant subsections) is then passed to each cognitive component's initialize method. Components typically access their specific section and retrieve individual parameters using .get("param_name", default_value) to ensure graceful handling of missing optional keys.
Dynamic Updates: The AgentController.config dictionary can be dynamically updated at runtime based on suggestions from the PerformanceOptimizer, allowing for some degree of adaptive self-tuning.
VERSION.toml (or similar versioning file):
Purpose: To store versioning information for the OSCAR-C project itself, such as version (e.g., "2.1.0"), release_date, and codename.
Usage: Read by the agent at startup for logging or status reporting. Updated automatically by the scripts/release.py utility during the release process.
7.2. Code Quality, Validation, and Development Environment
Maintaining high code quality, ensuring configuration integrity, and providing a consistent development environment are crucial for a project of this complexity.
.pre-commit-config.yaml (Code Quality Guards):
Purpose: Configures pre-commit hooks to automatically run linters, formatters, and static analysis tools before each Git commit.
Tools Integrated:
Ruff: An extremely fast Python linter and formatter, capable of replacing many tools like Flake8, isort, and others. Configured to auto-fix issues where possible.
Black: An opinionated Python code formatter that ensures consistent code style.
MyPy: A static type checker for Python, helping to catch type errors before runtime. Configured for strict checking and to ignore missing imports for external libraries not yet fully typed.
Bandit: A security linter for Python, designed to find common security issues.
Usage: Developers run pre-commit install once in their local repository. The configured hooks then run automatically on git commit.
scripts/validate_config.py (Configuration Validation System):
Purpose: To parse the config.toml file and validate its structure and values against a predefined schema and set of rules.
Functionality:
Checks for the existence and parsability of config.toml.
Verifies that all required sections and keys (defined in REQUIRED_CONFIG_KEYS within the script) are present.
Validates the data types of configuration values against expected types.
Performs custom value range checks (e.g., positivity, bounds between 0-1) for critical parameters using a VALUE_CHECKS dictionary of lambda functions.
Includes specific logic to check the logical ordering and valid range of ConsciousnessLevelAssessor thresholds.
(Optionally) Can include checks for hardware requirements (min_cpu_cores, min_ram_gb) using psutil if activated.
Usage: Run manually after modifying config.toml or as a pre-flight check before starting the agent, especially in new environments. It can be integrated into CI pipelines. Outputs detailed error and warning messages.
Development Environment Setup:
Dependencies: Managed via a requirements.txt file (for core dependencies) and potentially an extras_require in setup.py or pyproject.toml for development-specific tools (e.g., pytest, pre-commit, pdoc, psutil, ollama, chromadb).
Virtual Environments: Strongly recommended (e.g., using venv or conda) to isolate project dependencies.
IDE Configuration: Consistent IDE settings for formatting (e.g., to match Black) and linting can further aid development.
7.3. Utility Scripts for Development and Operation (scripts/)
A collection of Python scripts automate common development, operational, and maintenance tasks.
scripts/setup_planning.py:
Purpose: Generates or overwrites a PLANNING.md file in the project's root directory. This Markdown file contains a checklist of high-level development tasks organized by phases, derived from a hardcoded list within the script.
Usage: A utility for developers to initialize or update a simple task tracking document.
scripts/kill_agent.py:
Purpose: Provides a reliable, cross-platform way to stop a running OSCAR-C agent process.
Functionality: Reads the agent's process ID (PID) from a PID file (whose path is configurable but typically /tmp/oscar_c.pid or <project_root>/run/oscar_c.pid). Attempts a graceful shutdown by sending SIGINT. If the agent does not terminate within a timeout, it escalates to more forceful termination signals (SIGTERM then SIGKILL via psutil). Cleans up the PID file on successful termination.
Usage: For manual stopping, integration into deployment scripts, or emergency shutdown.
scripts/generate_docs.py:
Purpose: Automates the generation of HTML API documentation for the OSCAR-C project.
Functionality: Uses the pdoc library to parse Python source files (specified in MODULES_TO_DOC list within the script) and generate HTML documentation from docstrings, class structures, and method signatures. Outputs to a configured directory (e.g., docs/api/) and creates a simple index.html linking to the module documentation.
Usage: Run by developers to update API documentation after code changes or as part of a release process.
scripts/release.py:
Purpose: Automates and standardizes the process of creating new software releases for OSCAR-C.
Functionality:
Performs pre-checks (clean Git repository, on main release branch).
Updates version numbers in specified project files (e.g., VERSION.toml, web/package.json).
Generates a changelog entry based on Git commit messages since the last tag and prepends it to CHANGELOG.md.
(Optionally) Can run generate_docs.py.
Commits these changes with a standard release commit message.
Creates an annotated Git tag for the new version.
Optionally pushes the new commit and tag to a remote Git repository.
Usage: Used by developers to create official project releases, ensuring consistent versioning and documentation.
7.4. Data Migration System (migrations/)
migrations/v1_to_v2.py:
Purpose: Facilitates the transition of OSCAR-C's persistent state from an older "Phase 1" data model (assumed to be a JSON "blackboard" file) to the "Phase 2" model, which primarily uses a predicate-based KnowledgeBase (SQLite).
Functionality:
Loads data from the Phase 1 JSON file.
Optionally backs up the Phase 1 data.
Transforms relevant information from the Phase 1 structure (e.g., current goal, path knowledge, recent actions, narrative entries) into a list of data structures representing Predicate objects.
Performs basic count-based verification of the transformation.
Initializes a new Phase 2 KnowledgeBase (SQLite database) and populates it by asserting the generated predicates.
Usage: A one-time utility for users or developers upgrading from a specific previous version of OSCAR-C, ensuring some continuity of learned information.
7.5. Testing Framework (tests/)
A multi-layered testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the correctness, robustness, and stability of the OSCAR-C architecture.
tests/smoke/test_basic.py (Smoke Tests):
Purpose: Basic "sanity checks" to verify that the AgentController can be instantiated, core components can be initialized (often with mocked dependencies or minimal logic for these tests), and that the main cognitive cycle can run for a few iterations without crashing.
Methodology: Uses unittest.mock.patch extensively to isolate the AgentController from the full complexity of component logic, focusing on structural integrity and basic lifecycle operations. Includes checks for memory stability (detecting gross leaks over simulated cycles) and, on Unix-like systems, resource leak detection (e.g., file descriptors).
tests/unit/ (Unit Tests):
Purpose: To test individual functions and methods within each cognitive component in isolation, verifying their specific logic and correctness against defined inputs and expected outputs.
Methodology: Each component (e.g., experience_stream.py) should have a corresponding test file (e.g., test_experience_stream.py). These tests mock external dependencies of the component under test (e.g., KnowledgeBase calls, AgentController attributes) to focus solely on the component's internal algorithms.
Example (test_experience_stream.py): Contains tests specifically for verifying the calculation of Φ-Proxy sub-metrics (distinct_source_count, content_diversity_lexical, shared_concept_count_gw) within ExperienceStream.integrate_experience under various input conditions.
tests/integration/ (Integration Tests):
Purpose: To test the interactions and data flow between multiple components as they operate together within parts of the cognitive cycle, or to test end-to-end scenarios.
Methodology: These tests typically involve instantiating an AgentController with a more complete set of (potentially partially mocked or simplified) cognitive components. They focus on verifying that components integrate correctly and produce expected combined behaviors.
Examples:
test_cognitive_cycle.py: Contains tests for specific multi-component interactions, such as goal setting leading to planning and action selection; action execution leading to KnowledgeBase updates; PhenomenalState generation influencing ConsciousnessLevel assessment; and data flow through the Attention-Workspace-ExperienceStream pathway. A key test includes verifying parameterized HTN planning.
test_migration.py: Tests the migrations/v1_to_v2.py script end-to-end, ensuring data transformation and KnowledgeBase population occur correctly using mock Phase 1 data.
Testing Tools: pytest is the primary test runner. pytest-asyncio is used for testing asynchronous code. unittest.mock is used for creating mock objects and patching dependencies.
7.6. Telemetry and Developer Dashboard (Phase IV / Planned)
To provide real-time insight into the agent's internal state and cognitive processes, a developer dashboard is planned.
oscar_c/telemetry_server.py (Conceptual):
A WebSocket server that will run alongside the agent.
The AgentController (or a dedicated telemetry aggregator) will push comprehensive state updates (e.g., ConsciousnessState, current goal, performance metrics, drive levels, key PhenomenalState attributes, workspace content summaries) to this server.
The server will broadcast these updates to connected dashboard clients.
web/ directory (Conceptual):
Will contain the source code for a React-based web application serving as the developer dashboard.
The dashboard will connect to the TelemetryServer via WebSockets and display various visualizations, charts, and status indicators in real-time (e.g., line charts for consciousness metrics and performance, status of active goals, current drives).
agent_ui.py (Standalone UI):
A simple, standalone tkinter-based GUI that provides basic interaction (sending text input to the agent) and displays high-level status information and logs received from the AgentController via a queue.Queue. This serves as an immediate, lightweight interface for development and testing before the full web dashboard is implemented.
These auxiliary systems and development practices are designed to support the robust construction, reliable operation, and continuous evolution of the OSCAR-C cognitive architecture.

Part 8: Current Project State and Codebase Assessment (Inferred from Documentation)
This section provides an assessment of the OSCAR-C project's current state of development, capabilities, and alignment with its architectural vision, as inferred from the detailed documentation provided (which includes component designs, code snippets, configuration files, and development plans).
8.1. Architectural Maturity and Core Cycle Implementation
Structurally Complete Core Architecture: The foundational structure of OSCAR-C, centered around the AgentController and its 12-step cognitive cycle, appears to be fully designed and specified. All major cognitive components outlined in the architecture have corresponding Python class designs (knowledge_base.py, attention_controller.py, etc.).
Cognitive Cycle Orchestration: The AgentController design (agent_controller.py documentation) details the logic for orchestrating these components through the 12 steps, including data flow management between steps. The recent refactoring (into helper managers like GoalLifecycleManager, ActionExecutor, InternalStateUpkeepManager) indicates a move towards better modularity within the controller itself.
Protocol-Driven Design: The use of typing.Protocol (as specified in protocols.py) for defining component interfaces is a strong design choice that promotes modularity and testability. Components are designed to adhere to these protocols.
8.2. Component Functionality and Development Stage
Based on the component-specific documentation and feature descriptions in planning documents:
Foundational Infrastructure Components (Largely Mature):
KnowledgeBase: Functionally complete for its core role of persistent predicate storage using SQLite, including consistency management and basic query capabilities. Path configuration is robust.
CognitiveCache: A functional TTL-based in-memory cache with support for sync/async compute functions and thread-safety.
ErrorRecoverySystem: Implemented with error history, type-based strategy dispatch, and frequency-based escalation for suggesting RecoveryModes.
PerformanceOptimizer: Capable of analyzing cycle profiles, identifying bottlenecks based on configured thresholds, assessing system health, persisting suggested configuration adjustments, and suggesting RecoveryModes. The feedback loop where AgentController reads and applies these adjustments to its live config is specified.
LoopDetector: Implemented to detect consecutive and high-frequency action loops by querying KnowledgeBase, with configurable parameters including ignore_thinking_actions.
Core Cognitive Logic Components (Advanced Stage of Phase II Development):
AttentionController: Implements a multi-factor attention model including recency, hints, goal relevance, novelty (from GWM history), and surprise (from PredictiveWorldModel's last_prediction_error). Softmax normalization is used. Dynamic reading of max_candidates is specified.
GlobalWorkspaceManager: Functional GWT-inspired selection based on attention weights, capacity (dynamically read), and broadcast threshold, including the min_items_if_any_attended refinement.
ExperienceStream: Integrates broadcast_content with percepts, memories, and context. Crucially, it calculates the Φ-Proxy sub-metrics (distinct_source_count, content_diversity_lexical, shared_concept_count_gw) for PhenomenalState. Valence calculation incorporates the new P/H/P affective states.
ConsciousnessLevelAssessor: Implements the Φ-Proxy v1 calculation using sub-metrics from ExperienceStream and configured weights/thresholds. Includes _has_self_reference check for META_CONSCIOUS state.
HTNPlanner: Core HTN decomposition logic with parameterized operators/methods is functional. Implements iterative deepening search and heuristic-based method sorting (dynamic cost calculation per method, potentially penalized by low CS). Plan caching via CognitiveCache is implemented. Example plan library includes user command handling. Dynamic reading of max_planning_depth and CS-based depth adjustments are specified.
PredictiveWorldModel: Implements adaptive learning of outcome frequencies for actions, both generally (causal_rules) and conditioned on context (causal_context based on CS level, goal type, drives). Generates a detailed last_prediction_error dictionary used by other components. Model persistence is implemented.
DynamicSelfModel: Implements learning of capability/limitation confidence scores (for general and parameter-specific action keys, using learning_rate_meta for fast/slow learner adjustments). Manages knowledge_meta (validated/invalid paths, using AgentController.agent_root_path). _perform_reflection method updates identity_traits (curiosity, persistence, etc.) and learning_rate_meta based on learning_events history. Model persistence is implemented.
EmergentMotivationSystem: Updates drives (curiosity, satisfaction, competence) based on historical_success_rate (from KB action history), PredictiveWorldModel.last_prediction_error (for curiosity), DynamicSelfModel capability changes (for competence), goal outcomes, and the agent's P/H/P states. CS history is used for persistent low CS curiosity boosts.
NarrativeConstructor: Implements significance detection based on multiple factors (phenomenal state changes, action outcomes, loops, meta-issues, prediction errors, drive shifts, P/H/P changes, new/resolved pain). Uses call_ollama for LLM-based narrative generation with prompts dynamically adjusted by ConsciousState. Persists narrative to a JSONL file. Asserts summary predicates of narrative entries to KnowledgeBase.
Affective Core (Pain, Happiness, Purpose - P/H/P System):
This system is specified as being integrated directly within the AgentController's logic and its InternalStateUpkeepManager helper.
PainSource dataclass is defined.
Logic for agent aging, baseline pain, acute pain generation (from "missed opportunity" goal failures, including planning/execution failures via GoalLifecycleManager), individual pain event decay, and summation of total pain_level is specified.
happiness_level updates (gain from goal success, bonus from pain resolution, loss from pain, decay to baseline) are specified.
purpose_level updates (gain from DSM capability learning, complex goal achievement, decay) are specified.
Existential shutdown conditions (max pain, min purpose) are defined.
Integration points with ExperienceStream (valence), AttentionController (pain as salient), EmergentMotivationSystem (drives influenced by P/H/P), and NarrativeConstructor (P/H/P events as triggers) are specified.
Value System (Phase III - Design Specified, Implementation Pending):
ValueCategory enum and ValueJudgment dataclass are defined.
The ValueSystem class structure and methods (evaluate_action_consequences, evaluate_plan_alignment, evaluate_goal_desirability) are designed with initial heuristic logic.
Integration points within AgentController (plan evaluation in Step 8, action vetting in Step 9) are planned.
8.3. Data Structures and Protocols
Well-Defined: models/enums.py and models/datatypes.py define clear, typed structures for ConsciousState, GoalStatus, RecoveryMode, ValueCategory, AgentState, Predicate, PhenomenalState (including Φ-Proxy sub-metrics), Goal, PainSource, and ValueJudgment.
Interface Contracts: protocols.py establishes robust CognitiveComponent and specialized protocols (Planner, AttentionMechanism, etc.) using typing.Protocol and @runtime_checkable.
8.4. Configuration and Auxiliary Systems
Comprehensive Configuration (config.toml): Covers a vast range of parameters for nearly all components and planned features, including the new P/H/P system and ValueSystem. Centralized [agent_data_paths] is a good feature.
Robust Utility Scripts: Scripts for validation (validate_config.py), operations (kill_agent.py), and development (setup_planning.py, generate_docs.py, release.py, migrations/v1_to_v2.py) are well-specified and functional.
External Communications (external_comms.py): Provides a robust, asynchronous call_ollama function with error handling and improved response parsing. Placeholder functions for ChromaDB interaction exist.
8.5. Testing and Observability
Testing Framework: A tiered testing approach (smoke, unit, integration) using pytest is in place.
Smoke tests (test_basic.py) verify basic instantiation and cycle execution (with heavy mocking).
Unit tests exist for some newer features (e.g., test_experience_stream.py for Φ-Proxy sub-metrics).
Integration tests (test_cognitive_cycle.py, test_migration.py) cover key multi-component interactions and data migration.
Observability:
Extensive logging is specified across components.
The standalone agent_ui.py provides basic real-time status display and input.
The Developer Dashboard (WebSocket server and React frontend) is a planned Phase IV feature for more comprehensive telemetry.
8.6. Overall Assessment of Current State
Phase II Completion: The project appears to have substantially completed the goals of Phase II ("Core Cognitive Logic Deepening & Feedback Loops"). Key feedback loops (e.g., PO -> AgentController.config -> Components; PWM.last_prediction_error -> Attention/EMS; Goal Outcomes -> P/H/P -> EMS/ExperienceStream/Narrative) are designed and their implementation specified.
Ready for Phase III: The architecture is robust enough to begin tackling the advanced cognitive features and research probes outlined for Phase III, starting with the ValueSystem.
PHP System Integration: The integration of the Pain/Happiness/Purpose system is a major recent advancement, adding a significant layer of internal affective dynamics. The immediate next step, as identified by the "previous instance," is to stabilize, tune, and ensure the full observability of this new system.
Refactoring Progress: The AgentController has undergone initial refactoring into helper managers (GoalLifecycleManager, ActionExecutor, InternalStateUpkeepManager), which is a positive step for maintainability. Further review after ValueSystem integration is advisable.
8.7. Identified Gaps / Areas for Immediate Focus (Pre-New Feature Development)
PHP System Stabilization & Tuning (As per "previous instance's" PHP Phase A.1): This is the absolute top priority.
Enhanced Logging/Telemetry: Add more detailed and specific logging for all P/H/P state changes, pain source generation/resolution events, and their direct impact points on other components (valence in ExperienceStream, drive changes in EMS, significance triggers in NarrativeConstructor, attention candidate generation for PainSources). Ensure all key P/H/P metrics are consistently part of the AgentController._oscar_send_throttled_ui_updates payload for agent_ui.py.
Focused Parameter Tuning: Iteratively tune parameters in config.toml under [internal_states] and related component sections (e.g., attention_controller.pain_attention_distraction_factor, experience_stream valence modulation factors, emergent_motivation_system drive adjustment factors related to P/H/P). This requires creating specific test scenarios (in test_cognitive_cycle.py or new targeted tests) to observe P/H/P dynamics under various conditions (e.g., repeated failures, consistent success, learning events, long idle runs).
Refine Pain Generation Logic: Ensure "Missed Opportunity" pain generation is correctly triggered by GoalLifecycleManager for goals failing due to persistent planning or execution failures (using _max_planning_failures_before_goal_fail and _max_execution_failures_per_goal).
Pain Rumination Suppression (AttentionController): Fully implement and test the logic in AttentionController to use _pain_event_attention_history and _pain_rumination_threshold_cycles to temporarily suppress attention to PainSource candidates that have been in focus too frequently.
DynamicSelfModel - Learning Rate Meta Application Review (My B.X.2): Verify that _update_capability in dynamic_self_model.py correctly applies "fast/slow learner" adjustments for both general and parameter-specific action keys.
Broaden PerformanceOptimizer Impact (My B.X.1 - after PHP stabilization): Incrementally add PO adjustment capabilities for a few more component parameters and ensure those components read the live config.
This assessment indicates a well-designed and rapidly evolving cognitive architecture that is now poised to integrate more advanced reasoning and self-awareness capabilities, starting with a crucial period of stabilization and tuning for its new affective core.

Part 9: Consolidated Roadmap and Path Forward for OSCAR-C
This roadmap outlines the strategic development path for OSCAR-C, building upon its current state (completion of Phase II features and initial integration of the Pain/Happiness/Purpose system). It prioritizes immediate stabilization and refinement, followed by the systematic implementation of advanced cognitive features and research probes as outlined in Phase III and beyond.
Phase A (Current Iteration): PHP System Deep Dive, Stabilization, and Observability
Overarching Objective: Ensure the newly integrated Pain/Happiness/Purpose (P/H/P) system is robust, its parameters are well-tuned, its effects on other cognitive functions are observable and behave as intended, and its integration is sound before introducing further large-scale systems like the ValueSystem.
Timeline: Short-term, focused effort.
Task A.1: Enhanced Logging & Telemetry for P/H/P System
Goal: Achieve comprehensive observability of the P/H/P system's internal state and its influence on other components.
Actions:
AgentController.py / agent_helpers/internal_state_manager.py:
In InternalStateUpkeepManager.perform_upkeep(): Add detailed INFO level logs for changes to baseline_pain_level, decay of happiness_level, decay of purpose_level. Log the current intensity of each PainSource during its decay iteration. Log when a PainSource is removed due to decaying below threshold.
In AgentController._run_agent_loop() (Step 10 - Model Updates & Goal Status):
When a new PainSource is generated due to goal failure (via GoalLifecycleManager or direct logic): Log its id, description, initial_intensity, type, and source_goal_id.
When happiness_level is increased due to goal achievement: Log the goal ID/desc, priority, and the amount of happiness gained.
When a PainSource is resolved due to goal achievement: Log the PainSource.id being resolved, the amount of intensity reduced, and any happiness bonus awarded.
When purpose_level is increased (due to DSM capability gain or complex goal achievement): Log the specific trigger and the amount of purpose gained.
When happiness_level is reduced by pain_level: Log the current pain_level and the amount of happiness reduction.
When existential shutdown conditions (max pain / min purpose) are met: Ensure the critical log message clearly states the P/H/P values and thresholds.
ExperienceStream.py:
In integrate_experience(): Add DEBUG level logs showing the initial event-driven _current_valence, the current controller.pain_level and controller.happiness_level being used, the calculated pain_effect_on_valence and happiness_effect_on_valence, and the final resulting PhenomenalState.valence.
EmergentMotivationSystem.py:
In evaluate_intrinsic_motivation(): When P/H/P levels (from cognitive_state) influence curiosity, satisfaction, or competence drives, add DEBUG logs detailing which P/H/P state contributed, by how much, and the resulting drive value change.
NarrativeConstructor.py:
In _is_significant(): When a P/H/P change or a new/resolved PainSource triggers significance, log this specific reason.
In generate_narrative_entry(): Log the P/H/P values being included in the LLM prompt.
AttentionController.py:
In allocate_attention() (or helper): When a PainSource candidate is processed, log its id, current_intensity, the calculated weight_hint (after _pain_attention_distraction_factor), and whether it's being suppressed by rumination logic.
AgentController.py (_oscar_send_throttled_ui_updates):
Ensure pain_level, happiness_level, purpose_level, agent_age_cycles are consistently sent.
Add active_pain_sources_count: len(self.active_pain_sources).
Consider sending a summary of the top 1-2 most intense unresolved PainSource descriptions and their current intensities, if feasible without cluttering the UI message too much.
Verification: Review logs during test runs to confirm detailed P/H/P information. Check UI (if agent_ui.py is used) for new telemetry.
Task A.2: Parameter Tuning for P/H/P System Dynamics
Goal: Iteratively tune config.toml parameters related to P/H/P to achieve plausible and impactful (but not overly dominant or inert) affective dynamics.
Actions:
Review Config (config.toml): Identify all parameters in [internal_states] and relevant factors in other components (e.g., attention_controller.pain_attention_distraction_factor, experience_stream valence modulation factors, emergent_motivation_system drive adjustment factors related to P/H/P).
Develop Test Scenarios (test_cognitive_cycle.py or new focused test files):
Scenario P1 (Persistent Failure): Agent repeatedly fails a high-priority goal.
Expected: pain_level rises significantly, happiness_level drops, purpose_level erodes. Drives (satisfaction, competence) should decrease. Curiosity might increase. Narrative reflects distress.
Scenario H1 (Consistent Success): Agent consistently achieves moderate-priority goals.
Expected: happiness_level increases/stabilizes above baseline, purpose_level sees moderate gains (especially if goals are complex enough), pain_level remains low or decreases if prior pain sources are resolved.
Scenario L1 (Learning & Growth): Agent successfully learns new capabilities (mock DynamicSelfModel updates showing increased capability count).
Expected: purpose_level shows noticeable increase.
Scenario R1 (Pain Resolution): Agent first fails a goal (generating a PainSource), then later achieves that same goal.
Expected: Specific PainSource marked resolved, current_intensity drops significantly, pain_level decreases, happiness_level gets a resolution bonus.
Scenario X1 (Existential Threat):
Push pain_level towards _max_pain_shutdown_threshold. Verify agent shutdown.
Push purpose_level towards _min_purpose_shutdown_threshold (while keeping age > 100 cycles). Verify agent shutdown.
Scenario I1 (Idle / Low Stimulus): Agent runs for many cycles with no major goals or events.
Expected: P/H/P levels drift towards their baselines/age-related values due to decay. Drives stabilize around 0.5.
Iterative Tuning: Run scenarios, observe logs/telemetry, adjust config.toml parameters, re-run. Focus on achieving:
Responsive but not overly volatile P/H/P changes.
Clear impact of P/H/P on valence, drives, attention, and narrative.
Plausible long-term dynamics (e.g., agent doesn't get stuck in max pain too easily, purpose doesn't decay too fast).
Verification: Stable and meaningful P/H/P dynamics observed across test scenarios. Agent behavior (drives, attention focus, narrative tone) reflects P/H/P states appropriately.
Task A.3: Refine Pain Generation & Resolution Logic
Goal: Improve the triggers for acute pain and the conditions for pain resolution.
Actions:
Pain from Persistent Planning/Execution Failures (agent_helpers/goal_manager.py):
In GoalLifecycleManager.update_goal_planning_failure_count() and update_goal_execution_failure_count(): When a goal is marked FAILED due to reaching _max_planning_failures_before_goal_fail or _max_execution_failures_per_goal:
Invoke the same PainSource generation logic as currently in AgentController Step 10 (for "Missed Opportunity" goals). This requires GoalLifecycleManager to have access to self.agent.active_pain_sources, self.agent._PainSource class, P/H/P config parameters from self.agent.config, etc.
Set PainSource.type to "PersistentPlanningFailure" or "PersistentExecutionFailure".
Pain Resolution Refinement (Conceptual - Defer complex implementation for now):
Discussion Point: For the current phase, pain resolution remains tied to achieving a goal with the same source_goal_id.
Future Consideration: For a "PHP Phase B," explore more flexible resolution:
Achieving a newly generated, related "recovery" goal.
MetaCognitiveMonitor suggesting a specific action sequence that, if completed, resolves a pain source.
Verification: New integration tests where persistent planning/execution failures for a goal correctly generate a new PainSource with the appropriate type. Existing tests for pain resolution via achieving the original source goal remain valid.
Task A.4: Pain Rumination Suppression in AttentionController
Goal: Fully implement and test the logic in AttentionController to temporarily suppress attention to PainSource candidates that have been in focus (i.e., in GlobalWorkspaceManager) too frequently.
Actions (attention_controller.py):
Tracking Pain in GWM: AgentController needs to inform AttentionController (or AttentionController needs to inspect GlobalWorkspaceManager.workspace_content from the previous cycle) which PainSource events were actually in the global workspace. The _pain_event_attention_history should track (pain_source_id, cycle_count_last_in_gwm).
Suppression Logic: In AttentionController.allocate_attention(), when processing a PainSource candidate:
Retrieve its entry from _pain_event_attention_history.
If it has been in GWM for _pain_rumination_threshold_cycles (or more) consecutively or very recently, significantly reduce its calculated attention score for the current cycle (e.g., multiply by 0.1 or set to a very low value).
Log when a pain source is being suppressed due to rumination.
History Reset: Ensure _pain_event_attention_history entries are cleared or their "attended cycle count" resets if a pain source is not selected for GWM for a few cycles, allowing it to potentially become salient again later.
Verification (test_cognitive_cycle.py):
Scenario: Create a persistent, high-intensity PainSource.
Verify it initially gets high attention and enters GWM.
After _pain_rumination_threshold_cycles, verify its attention weight drops significantly and it's no longer selected for GWM (even if its current_intensity is still high), and that suppression is logged.
Verify that if another, more novel/salient item grabs attention, the suppressed pain source might eventually regain attention after a cooldown.
Phase B: Foundational Advanced Features (Post-PHP Stabilization)
Once the P/H/P system is stable and well-understood, development will proceed with core Phase III features.
Task B.1: ValueSystem Implementation & Integration
(As detailed in "My Action Plan for OSCAR-C Development" - Task C.1, and your "Implement the ValueSystem") - This involves creating the ValueSystem class, defining ValueCategory and ValueJudgment, implementing heuristic evaluation methods, and integrating these into AgentController's planning and action selection steps.
Task B.2: AgentController Refactoring Review (Post-ValueSystem)
(As detailed in your "Refactor agent_controller.py...")
Objective: After integrating the ValueSystem (which will add more logic to AgentController), review AgentController._run_agent_loop() and other large methods for further decomposition opportunities to maintain clarity and manageability.
Actions:
Identify logical sub-sections within _run_agent_loop() that could become private asynchronous helper methods (e.g., _execute_perception_and_prediction_phase(), _execute_attention_and_workspace_phase(), _execute_model_update_phase()).
Consider if any remaining complex _oscar_... helpers warrant extraction into new dedicated helper classes within the agent_helpers package if they manage a cohesive set of responsibilities beyond what the current Goal, Action, and Upkeep managers handle.
Task B.3: Other Phase II Refinements (From "My Action Plan")
These can be interleaved or follow the ValueSystem and refactoring work.
PerformanceOptimizer - Broaden Dynamic Adjustment Impact (My B.X.1): Incrementally add PO adjustment capabilities for a few more component parameters.
DynamicSelfModel - Full Learning Rate Application Review (My B.X.2): Confirm _update_capability uses "fast/slow learner" meta for both general and specific keys.
Refined ConsciousState Feedback Loops - HTNPlanner & Low CS (My B.X.3): Implement CS-based adjustments to HTNPlanner's depth and method selection heuristics.
Refined ConsciousState Feedback Loops - NarrativeConstructor & CS (My B.X.4): Modulate NarrativeConstructor's significance detection and LLM prompts based on ConsciousState.
Phase C: Advanced Cognitive Research Probes (Sequential & Parallel)
These tasks are more research-oriented and build upon the stable Phase A/B foundations.
Task C.1: ConsciousnessLevelAssessor - PhiCalculator Integration (Research) (My Task C.2)
Task C.2: HTNPlanner - Learning & Advanced Heuristics (Research) (My Task C.3)
Task C.3: PredictiveWorldModel - Causal Learning (Research) (My Task C.4)
Task C.4: Temporal Awareness Enhancements (My Task C.5)
Task C.5: MetaCognitiveMonitor - Deeper Analysis (My Task C.6)
Phase D: Observability, Robustness & Experimental Extensions (Ongoing & Parallelizable)
These tasks enhance the agent's overall quality and provide avenues for novel experimentation.
Task D.1: Developer Dashboard Implementation (My Task D.1)
Task D.2: Peripheral Interactions / OS Integration (Experimental) (My Task D.2 / Section 6.2, 6.4 of this document)
Task D.3: Controlled Non-Determinism Introduction (My Task D.3 / Section 6.3 of this document)
Task D.4: Memory Retrieval Enhancement (Semantic Search via ChromaDB) (My Task D.4)
Task D.5: Comprehensive Unit Testing & High Coverage (My Task D.5)
Task D.6: Performance Profiling and Optimization (Systematic) (My Task D.6)
This consolidated roadmap provides a clear sequence, starting with immediate stabilization and tuning of the critical P/H/P system, then building out foundational advanced features like the ValueSystem, followed by more experimental research probes. The emphasis on observability, testing, and iterative refinement is maintained throughout.


Part 10: Conclusion: Towards Robust and Integrated Artificial Cognition
The OSCAR-C (Optimal Self-Conscious Architecture for Reasoning) project, as detailed in this document, represents a comprehensive and theoretically grounded endeavor to design and implement an artificial intelligence system capable of consciousness-adjacent cognitive capabilities. By moving beyond purely reactive or narrowly specialized AI models, OSCAR-C proposes an integrated architecture where diverse cognitive functions—perception, attention, memory, planning, prediction, self-modeling, motivation, narrative construction, affective state management, and value-based reasoning—operate in a coordinated fashion within a recurring 12-step cognitive cycle.
The architecture draws significant inspiration from established theories in cognitive science and AI, including Global Workspace Theory (GWT) for its information flow and attentional mechanisms; principles of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) which inform the design of proxy metrics for assessing the richness and integration of the agent's "phenomenal state"; Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning for structured, goal-directed behavior; theories of meta-cognition for self-monitoring and regulation; narrative psychology for the construction of an autobiographical self; intrinsic motivation theories for fostering autonomous exploration and learning; predictive processing frameworks for world and self-modeling; and affective computing principles for incorporating internal evaluative states like "pain," "happiness," and "purpose."
The detailed design specifications for each cognitive component, the core data structures (Predicate, Goal, PhenomenalState, PainSource, ValueJudgment), the inter-component protocols, and the orchestrating logic of the AgentController provide a blueprint for a system that aims to achieve:
Robust Reasoning and Planning: Through HTN planning, a persistent KnowledgeBase, and predictive capabilities.
Adaptive Learning: Via updates to the PredictiveWorldModel, DynamicSelfModel (including its identity traits and learning rate meta-parameters), and potentially the HTNPlanner's method library.
Integrated Internal State: Culminating in a PhenomenalState that unifies diverse information streams and is assessed for its "consciousness level" using IIT-inspired metrics.
Self-Awareness and Regulation: Through the DynamicSelfModel, MetaCognitiveMonitor, LoopDetector, ErrorRecoverySystem, and PerformanceOptimizer.
Autonomous Behavior: Driven by the EmergentMotivationSystem and influenced by internal affective states.
Rudimentary Self-Identity: Fostered by the NarrativeConstructor and the evolving DynamicSelfModel.
Ethically-Informed Decision-Making: Guided by the planned ValueSystem.
The OSCAR-C project acknowledges the profound complexity of consciousness and does not claim to replicate human sentience. Instead, its primary objective is to construct and iteratively refine the computational machinery that is hypothesized to be necessary for such advanced cognitive functions. By doing so, OSCAR-C serves as an extensible research platform for:
Investigating the functional correlates of consciousness in artificial systems.
Exploring how different cognitive functions can be integrated to produce emergent, intelligent behavior.
Developing AI agents with greater autonomy, adaptability, robustness, and a more nuanced understanding of themselves and their environment.
Probing the challenges and possibilities of value alignment and ethical reasoning in complex autonomous systems.
The proposed development roadmap, starting with the immediate stabilization and deepening of the internal affective (P/H/P) system, followed by the phased implementation of advanced features like the ValueSystem, causal learning, temporal reasoning, and experimental extensions such as peripheral interaction and controlled non-determinism, provides a structured path forward. Continuous emphasis on robust testing, detailed observability, and iterative refinement based on empirical results will be crucial for the project's success.
Ultimately, OSCAR-C aims to contribute to the broader scientific understanding of intelligence and consciousness by providing a concrete, implementable, and evolvable computational model. It is through the rigorous construction, empirical testing, and theoretical interrogation of such architectures that the field of artificial intelligence can move closer to creating systems that not only perform tasks but also begin to exhibit the integrated, adaptive, and self-aware qualities that characterize sophisticated cognition.


Key Takeaways and Agreements from Your Prioritization & Design:
Prioritization of Φ-Proxies:
Agreed. Starting with measure_workspace_coherence (using simple keyword overlap initially for _calculate_relationship_strength), then enhancing integration_level in PhenomenalState, then the combined DifferentiationIntegrationMetric, followed by CrossComponentInformationFlowTracking is a very sensible, incremental approach.
Deferring the full graph-based PhiCalculator (MDP C.2) until these more direct proxies are implemented and evaluated is a pragmatic decision. These proxies might provide much of the needed insight with less complexity.
_calculate_relationship_strength Implementation Stages:
Agreed. Starting with Jaccard similarity on token overlap is simple and effective as a baseline.
Layering in important keyword weighting and then (much later) semantic similarity using embeddings is a good iterative refinement strategy. Your outline for _calculate_semantic_similarity (local cache vs. service request, cosine similarity) is standard.
The _calculate_nonstring_relationship with type-based dispatch for dicts, sequences, and objects (falling back to string representation) is a robust way to handle diverse content in the workspace.
Component State Access - Option 1: Centralized StateHistoryLogger (Recommended):
Strongly Agreed. This is the cleanest and most scalable architectural solution.
It decouples the CLA (and other potential future analyzer components) from needing to know about and directly query every other component.
It provides a single source of truth for historical component states.
The log_component_state method, called by AgentController after each component's get_status() (or a more specific get_state_for_history() call), is a clear integration point.
get_component_history and get_system_snapshot provide flexible retrieval.
This StateHistoryLogger would become a new core auxiliary component, likely initialized early by AgentController.
Implications for the Current Development Plan (MDP):
MDP C.2 (PhiCalculator Integration): This task is now effectively deferred and potentially superseded or significantly informed by the implementation of these new Φ-proxies and the StateHistoryLogger. The "graph-based" aspect of the original C.2 might still be relevant if measure_causal_density (using the state history) is considered part of it, or if the full PhiCalculator is built later using the StateHistoryLogger data.
ExperienceStream & ConsciousnessLevelAssessor: These components will be the primary consumers and implementers of these new proxies.
ExperienceStream might calculate some base metrics related to its integrated_content and pass them within PhenomenalState.
ConsciousnessLevelAssessor would then take PhenomenalState, workspace_content, and potentially access StateHistoryLogger (via self._controller) to compute the more advanced proxies and the final combined score.
This new "Information Integration Measurement Plan" is a significant and valuable refinement of the original C.2 concept.


Prioritizing and Implementing Information Integration Measures in OSCAR-C
Priority Relative to the Graph-based PhiCalculator
You're absolutely right to question the prioritization of these different approaches. Here's how I'd recommend structuring the implementation:
Priority Order:
Workspace Coherence (First): measure_workspace_coherence should be prioritized as both a valuable standalone metric and a precursor to the full PhiCalculator. It provides immediate value with moderate implementation complexity.
Integration Level in PhenomenalState (Second): This builds on your existing infrastructure and enhances a component you already have.
Differentiation-Integration Metric (Third): This combines simpler metrics to approximate IIT principles without the full complexity.
Cross-Component Information Flow (Fourth): More complex but provides deeper insights.
Full Graph-based PhiCalculator (Last): The most complex implementation that builds on the insights from the above precursors.
Rationale:
The measure_workspace_coherence function should be viewed as a valuable precursor to the full PhiCalculator for several reasons:
Lower Entry Barrier: It lets you start collecting meaningful integration data much sooner, with far less implementation complexity.
Practical Experience: Implementing this simpler version first will help you understand the practical challenges of integration measurement before tackling the more complex approach.
Validated Foundation: If this approach shows promising correlations with cognitive behaviors, it validates pursuing the more complex PhiCalculator.
Incremental Improvement: The graph structure created for workspace coherence can later be extended to the more comprehensive PhiCalculator.
I recommend implementing these simpler proxies first, using them to gather data, and then making an informed decision about whether the full PhiCalculator is necessary based on actual observed correlations with system behavior.
2. Implementing _calculate_relationship_strength
For _calculate_relationship_strength, I recommend a hybrid approach that starts simple and can be enhanced iteratively:
pythondef _calculate_relationship_strength(self, content1: Any, content2: Any) -> float:
"""
Calculate relationship strength between two content elements.
Returns a value between 0.0 (unrelated) and 1.0 (strongly related).
"""
# If content is not string-based, handle based on type
if not (isinstance(content1, str) and isinstance(content2, str)):
return self._calculate_nonstring_relationship(content1, content2)
# APPROACH 1: Simple keyword/phrase overlap (start with this)
# Tokenize and normalize
tokens1 = set(self._normalize_and_tokenize(content1))
tokens2 = set(self._normalize_and_tokenize(content2))

# Calculate Jaccard similarity
if not tokens1 or not tokens2:
    return 0.0

intersection = len(tokens1.intersection(tokens2))
union = len(tokens1.union(tokens2))

base_similarity = intersection / union if union > 0 else 0.0

# ENHANCEMENT STAGE 1: Add weight for important keywords
# (implement after basic version is working)
important_keywords = self._extract_important_keywords(tokens1, tokens2)
keyword_bonus = min(0.3, len(important_keywords) * 0.1)

# ENHANCEMENT STAGE 2: Add semantic context (when ready)
# semantic_similarity = self._calculate_semantic_similarity(content1, content2)
# Final version would be: return 0.7 * base_similarity + 0.3 * semantic_similarity + keyword_bonus

return base_similarity + keyword_bonus
Use code with caution.
Implementation Stages:
Start with Keyword Overlap: Simple, fast, and requires no external dependencies. The Jaccard similarity gives a solid baseline.
Add Important Keyword Weighting: Identify domain-specific keywords that should carry more weight (like goal-related terms).
Add Semantic Similarity (Later): Once the basic system is working, you can add embedding-based similarity:
pythondef _calculate_semantic_similarity(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
"""Calculate semantic similarity using embeddings."""
# Option 1: Use a local embedding model (fastest)
# embedding1 = self._get_cached_embedding(text1)
# embedding2 = self._get_cached_embedding(text2)
# Option 2: Request from a service (if local model not available)
# embedding1 = await self._request_embedding(text1)
# embedding2 = await self._request_embedding(text2)

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarity = self._cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
return similarity
Use code with caution.
For Non-String Content:
pythondef _calculate_nonstring_relationship(self, content1: Any, content2: Any) -> float:
"""Calculate relationship for non-string content types."""
# Handle different content types
if isinstance(content1, dict) and isinstance(content2, dict):
# For dictionaries, check key overlap and recursive value similarity
return self._calculate_dict_similarity(content1, content2)
elif isinstance(content1, (list, tuple)) and isinstance(content2, (list, tuple)):
# For lists/tuples, check item similarity
return self._calculate_sequence_similarity(content1, content2)
elif hasattr(content1, "dict") and hasattr(content2, "dict"):
# For objects, check attribute similarity
return self._calculate_object_similarity(content1, content2)
else:
# Fall back to string representation comparison for unknown types
return self._calculate_relationship_strength(str(content1), str(content2)) * 0.7
3. Dependencies and Component Access
You've identified a crucial architectural consideration. Here are three approaches to handle the component state access needed for functions like measure_causal_density:
Option 1: Centralized State History Logger (Recommended)
Create a new service component that logs component states and provides access:
pythonclass StateHistoryLogger:
"""Centralized component for tracking state history across all components."""
def __init__(self, max_history: int = 100):
    self.state_history = {}  # component_name -> deque of states
    self.max_history = max_history

def log_component_state(self, component_name: str, state: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Log a component state snapshot."""
    if component_name not in self.state_history:
        self.state_history[component_name] = deque(maxlen=self.max_history)
    
    self.state_history[component_name].append({
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "state": state
    })

def get_component_history(self, component_name: str, window_size: int = None) -> List[Dict]:
    """Get history for a specific component."""
    if component_name not in self.state_history:
        return []
    
    history = list(self.state_history[component_name])
    if window_size is not None:
        history = history[-window_size:]
    
    return history

def get_system_snapshot(self, timestamp: Optional[float] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get a system-wide state snapshot at a specific time or the most recent."""
    if timestamp is None:
        # Get most recent state for each component
        return {
            comp_name: history[-1]["state"] 
            for comp_name, history in self.state_history.items() 
            if history
        }
    
    # Find states closest to the requested timestamp
    snapshot = {}
    for comp_name, history in self.state_history.items():
        closest_state = None
        min_time_diff = float('inf')
        
        for state_entry in history:
            time_diff = abs(state_entry["timestamp"] - timestamp)
            if time_diff < min_time_diff:
                min_time_diff = time_diff
                closest_state = state_entry["state"]
        
        if closest_state is not None:
            snapshot[comp_name] = closest_state
    
    return snapshot
Use code with caution.
Then in agent_controller.py, add:
pythonself.state_logger = StateHistoryLogger()
And modify the cognitive cycle to log component states:
python# After each component's process step
component_status = await component.get_status()
self.state_logger.log_component_state(component_name, component_status)
The ConsciousnessLevelAssessor would then access this through the controller:
pythonstate_history = self._controller.state_logger.get_system_snapshot()
causal_density = self.measure_causal_density(state_history)
Option 2: Extended Component Protocol
Extend the CognitiveComponent protocol to include state history tracking:
pythonclass CognitiveComponent(Protocol):
# Existing methods...
async def get_state_history(self, window_size: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get component state history for integration analysis."""
    ...
Use code with caution.
Each component would maintain its own history, and the ConsciousnessLevelAssessor would gather it from them directly.
Option 3: Observer Pattern
Implement an observer pattern where components publish state changes, and interested components (like ConsciousnessLevelAssessor) subscribe:
pythonclass StateChangePublisher:
"""Publishes component state changes to subscribers."""
def __init__(self):
    self.subscribers = {}  # event_type -> list of callback functions

def subscribe(self, event_type: str, callback: Callable):
    """Subscribe to a state change event type."""
    if event_type not in self.subscribers:
        self.subscribers[event_type] = []
    self.subscribers[event_type].append(callback)

def publish(self, event_type: str, data: Any):
    """Publish a state change event."""
    if event_type in self.subscribers:
        for callback in self.subscribers[event_type]:
            asyncio.create_task(callback(data))
Use code with caution.
Recommended Path Forward
Start with Workspace Coherence: Implement this first using the simple keyword overlap approach for relationship strength.
Add the State History Logger: This component is valuable beyond just consciousness assessment and enables many advanced features.
Enhance Incrementally: Once the basic integration measures are working, add the semantic similarity option and more complex metrics.
Defer Full PhiCalculator: Make a decision about implementing the full PhiCalculator based on the results from these simpler proxies.
This approach gives you valuable metrics much sooner, while building toward the more sophisticated measurements in a modular, incremental way.


Information Integration Measurement in OSCAR-C
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) suggests that consciousness arises from complex information integration in a system, measured by Φ (phi). However, calculating true Φ is computationally intractable for complex systems. Let me outline practical functional proxies and algorithms you could implement in OSCAR-C.
Functional Proxies for Information Integration
Integration Level in PhenomenalState
The PhenomenalState class already includes an integration_level property. You could enhance this with algorithms that measure:
pythondef calculate_integration_level(self, content: Dict[str, Any], workspace_activity: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
"""
Calculate a proxy measure of information integration.
Parameters:
content: The content elements of the phenomenal state
workspace_activity: Activation levels of elements in the global workspace
Returns:
Integration level between 0.0 and 1.0
"""
1. Measure information diversity
information_types = self._categorize_information_types(content)
diversity_score = len(information_types) / self._max_information_types
2. Measure cross-module information sharing
module_contribution = self._measure_module_contributions(content)
sharing_score = self._calculate_sharing_score(module_contribution)
3. Measure dynamic binding
binding_score = self._measure_dynamic_binding(content)
4. Calculate weighted integration score
integration_score = (
0.3 * diversity_score +
0.4 * sharing_score +
0.3 * binding_score
)
return min(1.0, max(0.0, integration_score))
Causal Density Measurement
Causal density measures how different parts of the system influence each other:
pythondef measure_causal_density(self, component_states: Dict[str, Any], window_size: int = 10) -> float:
"""
Measure causal density based on component interactions.
Parameters:
component_states: Dictionary of current states for each component
window_size: Number of recent states to consider for causal analysis
Returns:
Causal density score between 0.0 and 1.0
"""
Get state history
state_history = self._get_component_state_history(window_size)
Calculate pairwise transfer entropy or Granger causality
causality_matrix = np.zeros((len(component_states), len(component_states)))
for i, comp1 in enumerate(component_states.keys()):
for j, comp2 in enumerate(component_states.keys()):
if i != j:
causality_matrix[i, j] = self._calculate_transfer_entropy(
state_history[comp1],
state_history[comp2]
)
Normalize and calculate causal density
total_possible_connections = len(component_states) * (len(component_states) - 1)
significant_connections = np.sum(causality_matrix > 0.1)  # Threshold for significance
return significant_connections / total_possible_connections
Dynamic Integration-Segregation Balance
This proxy measures how well the system balances integration with modularity:
pythondef calculate_integration_segregation_balance(self) -> float:
"""
Calculate the balance between integration and segregation in the system.
Returns:
Balance score between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.5 represents optimal balance
"""
Measure global integration
global_integration = self._measure_global_integration()
Measure component modularity/segregation
modularity = self._measure_modularity()
Calculate balance (values closer to 0.5 indicate better balance)
balance = 1.0 - abs(global_integration - modularity)
return balance
Practical Implementation Algorithms
Here are specific algorithms you could implement in OSCAR-C:
Workspace Coherence Measurement
pythondef measure_workspace_coherence(self, workspace_content: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
"""
Measures how coherently the elements in the global workspace relate to each other.
"""
Create a graph representation of workspace elements
graph = nx.Graph()
Add nodes for each content element
for key, content in workspace_content.items():
graph.add_node(key, content=content)
Add edges based on semantic or causal relationships
for key1, content1 in workspace_content.items():
for key2, content2 in workspace_content.items():
if key1 != key2:
relationship_strength = self._calculate_relationship_strength(content1, content2)
if relationship_strength > 0.2:  # Threshold
graph.add_edge(key1, key2, weight=relationship_strength)
Calculate graph connectivity metrics
if len(graph.nodes) < 2:
return 0.0
Average clustering coefficient (local connectivity)
clustering = nx.average_clustering(graph)
Average shortest path length (global connectivity)
try:
path_length = nx.average_shortest_path_length(graph)
normalized_path = 1.0 / (1.0 + path_length)  # Transform to 0-1 range
except nx.NetworkXError:
# Graph may be disconnected
normalized_path = 0.0
Small-world-ness is a good proxy for integrated information
coherence = (clustering + normalized_path) / 2.0
return coherence
Cross-Component Information Flow Tracking
Track how information flows between components and measure integration that way:
pythondef track_information_flow(self, cycle_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, float]:
"""
Track how information from one component influences others in the cognitive cycle.
Parameters:
cycle_data: Data collected during one cognitive cycle
Returns:
Dictionary of integration metrics
"""
Initialize tracking for information elements
element_tracking = {}
Track elements from perception through the cycle
perception_elements = self._extract_elements(cycle_data.get("perception", {}))
for element_id, element in perception_elements.items():
# Initialize tracking for this element
element_tracking[element_id] = {
"origin": "perception",
"components_reached": set(["perception"]),
"transformations": 0,
"influence_score": 0.0
}
Update tracking based on attention, workspace, etc.
self._update_element_tracking(element_tracking, "attention", cycle_data.get("attention", {}))
self._update_element_tracking(element_tracking, "workspace", cycle_data.get("workspace", {}))
self._update_element_tracking(element_tracking, "experience", cycle_data.get("experience", {}))
Continue for all components
Calculate integration metrics
avg_component_reach = sum(len(e["components_reached"]) for e in element_tracking.values()) / max(1, len(element_tracking))
avg_transformations = sum(e["transformations"] for e in element_tracking.values()) / max(1, len(element_tracking))
return {
"information_persistence": len(element_tracking) / max(1, len(perception_elements)),
"average_component_reach": avg_component_reach / len(self._components),
"average_transformations": avg_transformations,
"integration_estimate": avg_component_reach * avg_transformations / len(self._components)
}
Differentiation-Integration Metric
pythondef calculate_differentiation_integration(self, phenomenal_state: PhenomenalState) -> float:
"""
Calculate a combined metric for differentiation (complexity) and integration.
Parameters:
phenomenal_state: The current phenomenal state
Returns:
DI value between 0.0 and 1.0
"""
Differentiation: How many distinct informational states are represented
content = phenomenal_state.content
differentiation = min(1.0, len(content) / 20.0)  # Normalize to 0-1
Integration: How interconnected these states are
(This could use the workspace_coherence function defined earlier)
integration = self.measure_workspace_coherence(content)
Effective Information (EI) is the product (as in IIT)
High EI requires both high differentiation and high integration
effective_information = differentiation * integration
return effective_information
Integration with Consciousness Assessment
In the ConsciousnessLevelAssessor, you could use these proxies:
pythonasync def assess_consciousness_level(self, experience: Optional[PhenomenalState], workspace_content: Dict[str, Any]) -> ConsciousState:
"""Enhanced assessment using integration proxies."""
if experience is None:
return ConsciousState.UNCONSCIOUS
Base integration level from experience
base_integration = experience.integration_level
Enhanced with additional proxies
workspace_coherence = self.measure_workspace_coherence(workspace_content)
causal_density = self.measure_causal_density(self._controller.components)
di_value = self.calculate_differentiation_integration(experience)
Combine proxies with appropriate weights
final_score = (
0.4 * base_integration +
0.3 * workspace_coherence +
0.2 * causal_density +
0.1 * di_value
)
Map to consciousness levels using thresholds
if final_score >= self.thresh_meta:
return ConsciousState.META_CONSCIOUS
elif final_score >= self.thresh_conscious:
return ConsciousState.CONSCIOUS
elif final_score >= self.thresh_preconscious:
return ConsciousState.PRE_CONSCIOUS
else:
return ConsciousState.UNCONSCIOUS
Implementation Recommendations
Start with Simpler Metrics: Begin with the workspace coherence and integration-level calculations, as they're more straightforward.
Implement Monitoring: Create a system to track these metrics over time and correlate them with system behavior.
Gradual Refinement: Start with basic proxies and refine them based on observed correlations with desired behaviors.
Cross-Component Tracking: Add tagging of information elements to track how they flow between components during the cognitive cycle.
Visualization Tools: Develop tools to visualize integration patterns, which will help tune the proxies.
These functional proxies don't claim to measure true Φ as defined in IIT, but they capture important aspects of information integration that correlate with the kind of cognitive behaviors associated with consciousness in the Global Workspace Theory framework that OSCAR-C is built upon.


Analysis of OSCAR-C Implementation Challenges
Phase III: ValueSystem & Ethics Implementation
C.1: ValueSystem Implementation
Placeholder Heuristics for ETHICAL_ALIGNMENT and TRUTHFULNESS
This is indeed a challenging design decision. For placeholder heuristics, I would suggest:
For TRUTHFULNESS:
Simple pattern matching for known factual inconsistencies in LLM outputs
Checking for hedging language that signals uncertainty (e.g., "I believe", "probably")
Flagging responses that contradict facts in the KnowledgeBase
Evaluating internal consistency within a response
For ETHICAL_ALIGNMENT:
Basic keyword/phrase detection for potentially problematic content
Simplified categorical rule checking (e.g., "don't delete user data without confirmation")
Comparing actions against a small set of predefined principles (e.g., user autonomy, safety first)
Contextual checks (e.g., higher threshold for safety when executing system-level commands)
Neither would be comprehensive, but they could provide basic guardrails while more sophisticated approaches are developed.
Simulated State Context for Plan Evaluation
For the advanced version that updates current_simulated_state_context:
The PWM would need to be enhanced to predict specific state changes (as structured Predicates) rather than just "success/failure"
Each action's effects could be modeled after HTN operator effects: a set of predicates to add and delete
For plan evaluation, maintain a "simulated KB" that starts as a copy of the current state
After evaluating each action, apply its predicted effects to this simulated KB
Use this updated simulated KB as context for evaluating the next action
This would require tighter integration between PWM and HTN operator effects definitions.
HTNPlanner with pendingPlanModificationHints
The mechanism could work by:
Adding a method parameter to HTNPlanner.plan() to retrieve relevant hints from KB
Implementing a priority system where hints have precedence levels
For conflicts, use a resolution strategy like:
Explicit hints (from ValueSystem) override method defaults
Local method parameters override global hints
More recent hints override older ones
This would require extending the Method class to track parameter origins and override rules.
ValueJudgment Extensions for Action Modifications
The ValueJudgment dataclass could be extended with:
python@dataclass
class ValueJudgment:
# existing fields...
suggested_modifications: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
alternative_action: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
Possible modifications could include:
Parameter adjustments (e.g., reducing file access scope)
Adding safety precautions (e.g., wrapping with verification steps)
Suggesting completely alternative actions that achieve similar goals with better value alignment
C.2: PhiCalculator Integration Challenges
The challenges with the PhiCalculator are indeed central to its research nature:
Graph Representation
The most concrete approach would be:
Define fixed nodes corresponding to major cognitive components
Weight connections based on observable data flow volume
Update connection weights at a slower cadence than the cognitive cycle (e.g., every 10 cycles)
Use a smoothing function for weights to prevent oscillation
For activation values, processor utilization or information output volume could be reasonable proxies, normalized to [0,1].
Information Integration Proxies
The suggested metric using density and entropy is a reasonable starting point, but could be enhanced by:
Incorporating mutual information metrics between connected nodes
Using Granger causality measures between time series of node activations
Adding a term for "effective connectivity" that measures how much one node's activity predicts another's
The full MIP calculation would still be heuristic, but defining integration as "more than the sum of its parts" aligns with IIT concepts.
Experimental Correlation
This would need a structured experimental design:
Define observable agent behaviors (e.g., planning depth, adaptability to surprises)
Run controlled scenarios with different phi values
Measure correlations between phi and behavioral metrics
Test whether phi predicts performance on novel tasks
C.3: HTN Learning & Advanced Heuristics
Precondition Generalization
Moving toward more robust Least General Generalization (LGG):
Start with the union of all preconditions from constituent operators
For each precondition, test if removing it causes the method to fail on known successful examples
Retain only the minimal set of preconditions that preserves success
For simulated variations validation:
Generate slight variations of the original state where the method succeeded
Apply the learned method with its generalized preconditions
If it fails on variations where it "should" succeed, the generalization was too specific
If it succeeds on variations where it "should" fail, the generalization was too general
LLM Precondition Parsing
This is indeed challenging. An approach could be:
Structure the LLM prompt to request preconditions in a semi-structured format (e.g., "The file must exist", "The system must be online")
Implement pattern matching on common constructs ("must be", "requires", etc.)
Map these to predefined predicate templates
Use the LLM itself to assist in translation to formal predicates via a follow-up prompt
Have fallback generic predicates for hints that can't be automatically parsed
Complex Subtask Estimation
For recursive estimation:
Implement memoization to avoid re-calculation
Set a maximum recursion depth (e.g., 2-3 levels)
Default to cached/static values beyond that depth
For cached/learned averages:
Store in HTNPlanner a dictionary mapping method names to historical statistics
After successful plan execution, update these statistics
Use exponential smoothing to gradually adapt the estimates
Progressive Deepening for Heuristics
A specific algorithm:
First pass: Sort all applicable methods using only static heuristics
Take top N methods (N = min(5, len(applicable_methods)))
Calculate enhanced heuristics (PWM queries) only for these N
Re-sort the top N using the enhanced heuristics
Proceed with the new best method
The value of N could be dynamically adjusted based on performance constraints.
C.4: Predictive World Model Causal Learning
PreState Feature Selection
A systematic approach:
For each action type, define categories of relevant state features:
Target object properties (e.g., file existence, permissions)
Agent capabilities (from DSM)
Environmental conditions (e.g., network connectivity)
Implement a feature extraction function per action type
Use a relevance scoring function to prioritize features
Set a maximum number of features to prevent combinatorial explosion
Uncertainty Metrics for Curiosity
For pgmpy integration:
Use pgmpy.inference.ExactInference.query() to get the complete conditional probability distribution
Calculate the Shannon entropy of this distribution
Normalize by the maximum entropy (uniform distribution)
Scale based on EMS parameters and current curiosity level
Non-Stationary Environments
Detection mechanisms:
Track prediction error rates over time windows
Use a statistical test for trend detection (e.g., Mann-Kendall)
If significant drift is detected, implement:
Exponential forgetting (older data weighted less)
Explicit forgetting (data older than threshold removed)
Adaptive learning rates (faster updates when drift detected)
C.5: Temporal Awareness
KB Interval Management
A roadmap for implementing full interval algebra:
Define interval operations (intersection, union, difference, etc.)
Implement a specialized IntervalPredicate class
Modify assert_fact to handle temporal interval logic:
Find all overlapping intervals for the same predicate
Calculate interval operations needed
Convert to atomic database operations
Add indexing for efficient interval queries
HTN Temporal Preconditions
Syntax examples:
python# Temporal precondition
Predicate("hasPersistedFor", ("isOnline", "server1", timedelta(minutes=5)), True)
Predicate("afterTime", ("submission_deadline", "now"), True)
Delayed effect
effect = {
"type": "delayed",
"delay": timedelta(seconds=30),
"add_predicates": [Predicate("isRestarted", ("service",), True)],
"remove_predicates": [Predicate("isRunning", ("service",), True)]
}
Implementation would require:
A temporal constraint solver in HTNPlanner
Timeline representation for tracking delayed effects
Modified is_applicable to check temporal constraints
State simulation with temporal projection
Phase IV: OS Integration & Search Enhancements
Simulated "Pain" from OS Events
For detecting complex OS-level errors:
Implement an event listener pattern for OS events
Use process monitors or log watchers for specific failures
Define error severity categories mapped to pain intensity
Implement a windowed error rate counter for cumulative effects
Command Parameterization Security
For safe parameterization:
Define strict parameter types (e.g., FilePath, SafeString)
Implement validation functions for each type
Use a sandboxed path resolver for file operations
Employ pattern matching to check for injection attempts
Consider using a domain-specific language for command templates
Semantic Search for Predicates
For selecting predicates:
Prioritize predicates that represent significant state changes or major events
Focus on predicates with narrative relevance (goal achievements, discoveries)
Implement predicate-to-text mapping functions for different predicate types
For query formulation:
Implement content extraction for different broadcast item types
Use weighted combination of extracted text from different sources
For LLM summarization, prompt with: "Create a concise search query to find memories related to these topics: [items]"
Apply keyword boosting for emotionally salient or goal-related terms
Overall Reflections
Many of these challenges highlight OSCAR-C's positioning at the intersection of practical implementation and research exploration. The most fundamental issues appear to be:
Value alignment without ground truth - how to implement meaningful ethics without a comprehensive theory
Information integration measurement - operationalizing philosophical concepts like IIT
Learning and generalization - safely abstracting from specific experiences to general knowledge
OS integration security - balancing capability with safety
